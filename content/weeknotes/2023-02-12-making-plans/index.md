* I have been writing some docs on OAuth 2.0 and Okta. The feature depends the [client credentials grant type](https://www.oauth.com/oauth2-servers/access-tokens/client-credentials/). I find it frustrating that while OAuth is meant to be a standard, tasks like getting a client credentials token are so variable. Despite the docs on the Okta sponsored OAuth 2.0 site saying otherwise, Okta require the use of a private key authentication type for client credential requests when accessing the management API.  
* I'm going to Kubecon EU in Amsterdam this year and will be co-presenting the [OPA talk in the maintainer track](https://sched.co/1HyTa)! I'm excited to go again after enjoying Valencia last year - and this year by train too!  
* Proactively, & in response to [recent events](https://techcrunch.com/2023/02/09/twitter-puts-its-developer-community-website-behind-a-login-after-announcing-new-api-pricing/), I have [decommissioned](https://github.com/charlieegan3/tool-twitter-rss) my Twitter to RSS tool. I'm sad about this as it was a really nice way to consume Twitter. I still know some people using it and would have liked to have been able to continue to read it in this way. I have also removed my other [long-standing integration](https://github.com/charlieegan3/tool-json-status/commit/8f4cc7a9e3214ea7de365de9771157463c67af1f) which shows my latest tweet on my personal homepage.  
* At the same time, I'm greatly enjoying have a [Mastodon account](https://hachyderm.io/@charlieegan3), I only wish I didn't need to run a Redis instance to host my own instance. I'm going to be closely watching projects like [Wildebeest](https://blog.cloudflare.com/welcome-to-wildebeest-the-fediverse-on-cloudflare/) and [GoToSocial](https://github.com/superseriousbusiness/gotosocial) since I would like to use my on my own domain at some point.  
* I am enjoying trips to with [Govinda's](https://govindas.london) greatly.

* It was nice to bump into an old [Computation Club](https://london.computation.club) friend in Hampstead Heath.  
* I went to a meme, battery hen, spin class at [Soul Cycle](https://www.soul-cycle.com/uk/). I'll stick to my own bike at home... Spin classes are terrible at not explaining how long the intervals are.
