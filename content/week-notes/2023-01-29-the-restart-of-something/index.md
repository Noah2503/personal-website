* I started a new job at [Styra](https://styra.com) in December and have been learning to be productive while working on more different tasks at once. I have found daily note pages with tasks completed and TODOs helpful. 'Carrying' TODOs over to the next day feels very natural.
* The process of writing daily notes reminded me of the week note idea I picked up in 2020. I [fell off the bandwagon](/week-notes/2020-12-27-week-notes-18/) at the end of the year but my new daily note process and seeing [Tom's](https://tomstu.art/weeknotes-160-shuffling-around) dedication to writing interesting week notes I thought I'd give this another go. I feel that summarising information as a record is a good exercise.
* This week in my open source work on [OPA](http://openpolicyagent.org) I have been working on [this PR](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/5576) which makes it possible to surface location information for an parsed Rego file. This will be useful to build language tooling on top of the output. I have also been making it [clearer](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/pull/5592) when users view outdated pages.
* We all need some r&r after a year of waiting for *Halo: Infinite* to work. In spite of [this trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wlvYh0h63k) I played some *Rainbow Six Siege* this week. It was ok, but the stand out gaming moments this week have been playing [*It Takes Two*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It_Takes_Two_(video_game)) split screen at home.

* I enjoyed attending my first Parkrun of the year, event [#531](https://www.parkrun.org.uk/hampsteadheath/results/531) in Hampstead Heath.
* This week's part-time Friday was well spent visiting my elderly uncle in Reading. We went to the pub and chatted about how things used to work over lunch. [Sadly](./tweet.png), the Elizabeth line didn't seem to be a viable route - though I enjoyed using it to get from Tottenham Court Road to Paddington.
* On impulse, I went to see [Matilda the Musical](https://uk.matildathemusical.com) after really enjoying the recent film with the same name.
