## Abstract

Whatâ€™s the highest value platform feature you can offer your Kubernetes tenants? It might be standardizing workload
identity and policy controls. In this session, we will discuss desirable properties for a workload identity and present
a modern architecture built on SPIFFE and cert-manager which uses Open Policy Agent (OPA) for policy decisions. This
should leave you with actionable ideas to help you re-evaluate your workload identity functionality and security
posture.
