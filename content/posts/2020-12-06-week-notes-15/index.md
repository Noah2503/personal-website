- My lemon scented geranium is dying.
- [Deep Rock Galactic](https://www.deeprockgalactic.com/) has been a lot of fun this week (it's still on Xbox Games Pass). Initially I wasn't particularly excited by the game, the first few missions were pretty repetitive and I didn't like not being able to play *same* the mission again when we failed. However, it's actually proven itself to be far more varied than expected and a lot of fun as a more casual social game. The progression is very slow, but the upgrades to equipment when you do finally unlock them feel worthwhile.
- I've not been exercising much this week. Closest I came to cycling aside from watching [GCN](https://www.youtube.com/user/globalcyclingnetwork) videos was repairing my derailleur hanger. I still can't spell derailleur first time. Having a proper stand to clean and fix the bike has been a particularly good value purchase.
- I finally caved and got an [Element ROAM](https://uk.wahoofitness.com/devices/bike-computers/gps-elemnt-roam) cycle computer. I've been having fun lining up routes for Christmas rather than doing any real cycling. I've been using a [Quad Lock](https://www.quadlockcase.co.uk/) mount until this point but have been worried about the vibrations damaging the autofocus in my iPhone which is my main camera these days.
- At work we're in the process of pivoting slightly different thing, more aligned with what is currently called [cert-manager Enterprise](https://www.jetstack.io/cert-manager/). It's given us some more focus on something specific, but there's a lot of work to do...
- spider plant is going strong.
