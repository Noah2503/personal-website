- Still at home with my parents and Alfie the dog for Christmas. Here is a photo of the Cromarty Firth, looking Northwest towards Dingwall taken from the Black Isle.

- I've been cooking. Highlights so far probably [this cassoulet](http://annajones.co.uk/recipe/tomato-coconut-cassoulet), and a Paneer Butter Masala from [Fresh India](https://www.waterstones.com/book/fresh-india/meera-sodha/9780241200421).
- I haven't really been able to cycle because of the ice and snow. I've also had a sore knee and so have been off running too. Fairly typical Christmas break in that regard where I plan to do much more exercise than really happens - for one reason and another.
- I have however made some progress on my [beancount](https://beancount.github.io/docs/) importer which I've unimaginatively called *'accountant'*. I have my current account and credit card imported with the payments between the two matched up. It's been pretty satisfying to get a picture of my expenses over the two accounts. I've now moved on to importing my Stocks and Shares ISA. I need to do average cost booking of funds in there, and [average cost booking](https://beancount.github.io/docs/trading_with_beancount.html#average-cost-booking) is sadly a bit of a faff in beancount. Since my `.beancount` files are generated by *accountant,* I'm less worried about using the stock splitting method it describes as unsatisfactory. I'm not 100% sure, but I believe this is the method that's expected for CGT reporting in the UK based on this [help page](https://www.gov.uk/tax-sell-shares/same-company).
- It's been positively *thrilling* to use my camera (Fujifilm x100F) to take photos rather than as a webcam. I've been experiementing with the raw .RAF files and have been pleasantly surprised by the support for these in iOS and various apps. I've signed up for a Lightroom trial which I will likely (sadly ðŸ˜ž) cancel after my holiday is over. You can find my December photos [here](https://photos.charlieegan3.com/archive/month/2020-12). This is a photo of Alfie being a good boy.
