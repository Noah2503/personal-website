- This week after work Iâ€™ve been doing a bit of side project house keeping. Iâ€™ve mostly been automating backups of my Notion and Dropbox data using GitHub actions. Iâ€™ve also automated my [contact export](https://charlieegan3.com/posts/2020-06-06-notion-contacts-list/) from Notion. While we wait for Notion to release a public API, the private API seems to be relatively easy to use for such tasks. GitHub actions isnâ€™t perfect but itâ€™s free and it sends me emails when things break.
- My â€˜mainâ€™ side project at the moment is some kind of â€˜queryable overlayâ€™ populated on data in my Dropbox. The idea is to be able to search for photos based on their location and other EXIF data - as well as perhaps eventually faces and other smarts. Iâ€™m interested to know what my highest altitude photo is, for example.
- At [work](https://preflight.jetstack.io/) Iâ€™ve been trying to understand how to represent severity of warnings raised about clusters and things running in them. There are many different dimensions: security, availability considerations; how confident we are that weâ€™re right; and how much impact the worst case scenario has.
- I also had some really valuable feedback from a senior colleague on a design proposal I'd written. I've never really had feedback on that before and found it to be really helpful. I'm planning to write the notes as a blog post.
- AFK, Iâ€™ve been for two swims at the [Parliament Hill Lido](http://parliamenthilllido.org/). Pleasantly surprised at both how close and how clean it is. I am thinking of buying a [wetsuit](https://uk.roka.com/collections/mens-wetsuits/products/mens-maverick-comp-ii-wetsuit?variant=13603914743919) however as I canâ€™t really stay in there for more than 20 mins safely. My feeling is that itâ€™ll only get colder...
- Last weekend someone tried to snatch my phone so I bought a cheaper backup iPhone 5SE. I was really impressed by the nearby device [quick start feature](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT210216). I also bought what is effectively a [Â£14 keyring](https://www.quadlockcase.co.uk/collections/accessories/products/phone-ring-stand?variant=31349703573619) for my Quad Lock case.
- Back at work, the video calling arms race continues and I got sucked into it this week after [someone](https://twitter.com/_jsfuentes?s=21) sent me a link to a Â£6 capture card on eBay...

- Iâ€™ve booked my trains home for Christmas. Booked to visit my granny for the first time this year. And tried to book a trip to Edinburgh but LNER said not yet.
- Weâ€™ve been playing Sea of Thieves. We all find the controls infinitely frustrating and still canâ€™t seem to beat any other ships with real players in them. That said, we still seem to enjoy it, firing people out of canons and drinking grog is fun too.

- On Sunday, I was meant to have a run+bike brick session but ended up [running with Luke](https://www.strava.com/activities/3987602822) so decided to [double](https://www.strava.com/activities/3985526181) [up](https://www.strava.com/activities/3985795212) on the bike while I waited ðŸ¥µ
