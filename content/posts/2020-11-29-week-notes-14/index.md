- At work I'm working on something to process a list of related Kubernetes objects into a graph structure. The edges in the graph need to be described in a flexible way. For example, use value `foo` in field`metadata.name` to find a resource of kind `Secret` called `foo`and so on. I've been making heavy use of [gabs](https://github.com/Jeffail/gabs) to pluck one or more matching values from the resource data and it's working really nicely.
- I played a fun 'mode' on Among Us called [hide and seek](https://www.hitc.com/en-gb/2020/11/03/among-us-how-do-you-play-hide-and-seek-setting-rules/). It seems to be hard to balance, but it's a fun way to start/end an evening of playing with friends.
- I learned the hard way that when you spot a fraying gear cable, and give it a vigorous test, sometimes it breaks and gets stuck in the shifter. Removing this little blighter from a modern Shimano shifter was a nightmare.

- Had the strange experience of cycling around London on Zwift. If there were no cars on the road, why would I cycle in a tube tunnel? [Leith Hill is grim, can we have Elephant and Castle back?](https://zwiftinsider.com/route/greatest-london-loop/)
- On Monday night I finally decided that I'd rather consume Twitter as a daily digest. I built something in GitHub Actions to generate a feed with an entry containing the tweets for just that day. So far it's been a big improvement - not sure why I didn't do this ages ago. No adverts, no confusing reorderings etc.
- This week's gaming highlight was grinding on the pipelines in [Deep Rock Galactic](https://store.steampowered.com/app/548430/Deep_Rock_Galactic/), trumps even a Warzone win!

- New music for me this week has been [Peggy Gou](https://open.spotify.com/track/1GZJu6ciZ55S8Kp1s8Z5ex?si=H4ceEGxVQf-gdiadK7jULQ) & [Bicep](https://open.spotify.com/track/73X9X7kDgsm4YeHpc8prf6?si=qKX_btR5QTq2l5m9QzSaIQ). New but familiar has been more... [Pendulum](https://open.spotify.com/track/7eJqLdEQ96D5Xzc406xkeZ?si=QKrOhvEoSMKAnzAF54DhgQ)! Also, my shameless kitchen-cooking-dancing-song has been [this banger](https://open.spotify.com/track/75rGONmoi48LLYBFaGiYsv?si=6bg1yRqISK-ig2qQ5hJRSQ). ðŸ•º
- Iâ€™m still doing my best to stop looking at Slack and read my book over lunch. Iâ€™m reading [Designing Data Intensive Applications](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781491903063/) and have just completed the section on graph databases. When Iâ€™m finished I need to play more with Datalog. This is particularly interesting to me since itâ€™s what OPAâ€™s Rego is based on (and we use OPA extensively at work).
- I have just started watching [Giri/Haji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giri/Haji) which I am so far enjoying.
- I fell off my bike [today](https://www.strava.com/athletes/1238371), on a road called 'Skid Hill Lane'... Three of us fell off after I slipped on a muddy corner but all made it home ok. A few bits of clothing and bike to replace but otherwise a nice ride. I really like Kent, it's quiet.
