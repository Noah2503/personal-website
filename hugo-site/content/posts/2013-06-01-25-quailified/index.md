My first year at university came to an end yesterday at 11:30 when I finished
my ‘Web Technology’ exam. It’s been a fast few months but in that time I feel
I’ve learnt enough to have an opinion on the university way.

I should first mention that I’ve actually really enjoyed my first year and I’m
looking forward to coming back again this September. There are still a few
'issues’ however, here’s my take.

## Aberdeen Agitations
The first set of problems, are, from what I can see,
unique to the Aberdeen Computer Science department, however somewhat limited
experience makes that rather hard to say with any degree of certainty.

_Discipline Breadth_ there’s a system that requires us to choose subjects that
are from other departments. This, as an option, would be quite a good idea,
giving people the choice to learn a little broader should perhaps be
encouraged, but never compulsory. Compulsory was what school was for. In making
it to university, and to study Computer Science, one hopes that you’ll be able
to spend all your time doing your chosen subject, something you’d hopefully
enjoy. You should, but it’s not the case at Aberdeen. Here there are only five
first year Computer Science courses, _five out of 8 'slots’_. This means you’ve
got to take on extra courses that often aren’t relevant or enjoyable to you.
Not a very good system, if you’ve chosen Computer Science, you should be able
to spend your time in pursuit of that.

_Course Coordination_ There were a few poorly ran courses this year, out of the
five that is. This involved things like: irrelevant and expensive textbooks;
tutorials with no answers or means of getting them; a lack of past papers;
impossibly 'full’ lectures (90 sides); unclear assignments and so on. Most of
these issues, but not all, upon inspection, seemed to be related to the
constantly refreshed courses. There’s a definite trend in the department to
completely revamp courses - all the time. In theory this sounds like a good
idea, fresh content and all that, however the reality is the list above -
complete absence of valid learning material and student support. It leads to a
rather unsatisfactory 'test subject’ feeling.

## The Discipline
While some problems point to issues at a university level I
think there are,  more fundamental, issues with the way the subject is taught
in general.

Let’s face it, Computer Science is programming. Knowledge of other areas
(Networking, HCI…) are best learnt when explored with a programming project in
mind and behind, at least that’s how I see it. Given the chance, I’d focus the
courses more on current technologies, with one or two that focused on cross
language skills. For example, one course on Applied Math that takes time to
cover implementations in many languages. Another on design patterns such as the
MVC, again with an effort to link it to real world technologies. This would
leave the rest open to current trends such as a course in RoR or iOS
development.

The common argument against such an approach is: the knowledge gained from
looking at particular technologies depreciates very quickly. My response would
be: most of the things you could cover will remain valid past the end of your
degree. All you need is skills that get you into the workplace after
university, from then on it’s a case of learning on the job and keeping up to
date. Also,_ it’s not like new languages and patterns are totally alien_, they
need to be attractive candidates for adoption where possible. This means
there’s often strong similarities between languages. University should expose
you to as many different techniques and languages as possible to broaden your
horizons and help you choose areas of interest and further study.

## University Education
The highest level problems are with the way university education works as a
whole.

I’ve had one very poorly ran course this last session, the teaching was
terrible and I turned to on-line resources at [Khan
Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/),
[cgcc](http://www.youtube.com/user/cgcclive) and [UCBerkley](http://www.youtube.com/user/UCBerkeley).
These videos and tutorials really got me thinking. Do we need universities to
exist as physical institutions? Do degrees need to be so lengthy and
inflexible?

I don’t think they do. As long as there’s funding to make **one **good,
English, Computer Science, course then that’s all we need. _Don’t try and get
researchers to teach if they can’t_, have natural teachers doing the teaching!
About feedback and assessments, programs are easy to mark automatically and if
people do the courses as alongside work then employers can see the results.
[On-line testing](/blog/2013/03/16/evil-e-assessments) is getting better
too.

Putting these measures in place would greatly reduce the cost of the whole
ordeal. Not to mention how much more accommodating the system would be for
different learners with different paces.

Communities like [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/), [Piazza
](https://piazza.com/)and [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/) are all
_well on their way_ to achieving this. Given more funding for a greater student
base these places have the power to, not only change the way we teach and learn
the subject but the industry as a whole, and definitely for the better.

In conclusion, Computer Science is an exciting area to be (trying to) get
involved in, however it’s being let down by an outdated teaching model.
