Gamification is a new word for me, even while the concept isn’t. Gamification
is the process of implementing a social system that borrows elements from video
games. 

I’ve been aware of such set-ups with services from Foursquare, Codecademy and
stackoverflow. In many ways it’s odd that I’d never heard the word, I certainly
like the idea.

I like the idea that we can keep people engaged in the system and push them to
behave in a way that benefits them and others online. I’ve seen a number of
techniques adopted, here are some of the better ones.

Badges, medals, ribbons - call them what you like - they all work the same way.
Users can be rewarded for certain actions, this will add to a collection, a
collection of virtual achievements that represents them and their online status
or rank. Status online is of exceptional importance, with it being so open and
often impersonal, users needs to be able to evaluate others. These rewards
paint a picture that helps us suss each other out.

Badges also help keep users returning to the service. People get hooked, and
these systems exploit that. But I don’t think this is a bad thing, in fact I
think it helps build more full, interconnected and active communities online.

Badges don’t however rely on a large user base. True, many badges are awarded
for social activities, however, not all badges need to be for this. Other
badges can help encourage lone users to participate all the same - even if
it’s while they wait for their friends to join up. This has certainly been
the case for me with Foursquare.

Privilege Unlocks. My next personal favourite. These, rather than useless tags,
are abilities that can be earned. These might include things like moderation,
voting, correcting and so on. Certainly if you’re getting involved with an
online community, these privileges can be very highly valued, and are
desirable. Another advantage of course, these privileges, namely moderation,
can keep your system cream and healthy without incurring too much additional
work on your part.

Leader-boards is another feature I’ve seen, implemented again in Foursquare.
While fairly easy to implement, and understand, this can really help give user
activities at competitive side. Providing point allocation is sound this
competition can exponentially help a system grow and flourish.

One final feature that I believe deserves a mention is the idea of Bounties.
I’ve only ever seen these at stack overflow, however, I think they’re powerful
enough to get a mention here. Bounties need to work alongside a user score
system, they can be implemented manually or automatically to promote strong
positive deeds that are highly desired within the community. This might be
answering a tough question all correcting and improving an existing resource.

All in all, I think the effects of a grounded Gamification system can be so
much more than just a gimmick.
