<p class="p1">Lately I&rsquo;ve been playing quite a bit of Mass Effect 3, namely the multiplayer. It&rsquo;s been good fun and I&rsquo;ve gotten a lot more into it than I did last time - I&rsquo;ve enjoyed taking on the more difficult levels with friends. I really like the game and I&rsquo;ll keep playing it for a good while yet - however I really dislike their levelling up implementation.</p>
<p class="p1">It&rsquo;s the random element to it that I hate, I really dislike the idea that you&rsquo;re not in direct control of how to level up. In games you earn credits and they can be spent on &lsquo;packs&rsquo; - these contain semi-randomly assigned pieces of kit and unlocks. There are different types of packs, allowing you to vaguely steer out your path but there&rsquo;s still next to no control. Basically you have to put up with what you get - there&rsquo;s no player influence what so ever.Â </p>
<p class="p1">I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;ve done it to be different or original either - I think they&rsquo;re just trying to make it addictive. The chance element keeps you coming back - I guess they hope that sometimes that involves spending some Microsoft points to fast track. It&rsquo;s like trading card packs - you might get the best player in the league or the god card, but most likely you&rsquo;ll only get rubbish or cards you don&rsquo;t want.</p>
<p class="p1">Not only do I think it&rsquo;s marginally exploitative but I don&rsquo;t l also dislike the lack of any foresight or goal. In other games you save up for certain items - Mass Effect 3 lacks the motivation of a long term goal. I think this is really important to keep me interested, and is perhaps the reason I stopped playing the first time round.</p>
<p class="p1">Once you&rsquo;ve got a few good weapons and characters the gameplay is very good, and great fun to play with friends. It&rsquo;s just all the time spent in the lobby, out of game, that really lets the experience down.</p>
