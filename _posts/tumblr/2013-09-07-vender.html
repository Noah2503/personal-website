<p>I&rsquo;ve spent most of the week (a series of 12 hour days) working with a web application called <a href="http://www.vendhq.com/" target="_blank">vend</a>. It&rsquo;s a program of my own selection and I was keen to get it working in the small business before I go back to university.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a wonderful piece of software and is just what the business needs. It's fantastically simple to use and has a great set of reports built right in. It also ties in with Xero, the companies accounts web app of my choosing. There&rsquo;s capacity to marry them all up now and I think given a little time it will happen. It&rsquo;s just a shame I&rsquo;m not going to see it happen!</p>
<p>Vend does have some foibles though and there were times when I really worried about it. It&rsquo;s actually quite locked down.</p>
<p>Firstly you <strong>can&rsquo;t delete sale data</strong>. Only void it. I guess this makes sense but if there&rsquo;s a 100 test sales that I fired in during testing then voiding them all is just a pain. You can delete all your data during the trial but after that point there&rsquo;s no going back with a chat via email to support.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not as easy as it should be to print a long run of barcodes for a lot of products. You need to make a sale order (as if you&rsquo;d bought in the products and needed to print the labels for them). That method aside there&rsquo;s no way to print a large number of barcodes. We used generic items to GOOJF on this issue but it&rsquo;s a far from optimal solution.</p>
<p>Customer files are great but notes don&rsquo;t have multiple lines for some reason. This makes the notes (a field that we&rsquo;d used a lot in the old system) really cumbersome. Still, it just shows us: this is not where to store that data - and it probably a good thing.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no option to duplicate a product, this is really quite annoying if you&rsquo;re adding in loads of similar products in on go as we have been this week. I found however that you can press back after new product posting and edit the data to resubmit a new product with slightly different details. Still, little hacks like that shouldn&rsquo;t be needed to get the job done really.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s basically a pretty quick system but sometimes it really hangs on product editing. I have no idea why that should be. It also went down for about 30mins on Thursday this week. However this doesn&rsquo;t mean that you can&rsquo;t make sales. The javascript in the sales page and keep a track of it in local data. I was <em>really</em> impressed by this.</p>
<p>Vend&rsquo;s support has been okay, once you&rsquo;re into a ticket you&rsquo;re laughing but that can take a few hours. With other software I&rsquo;ve found the service to be faster. Still, there&rsquo;s always the option of phone support for $39 extra - it&rsquo;s something the shop might need in the end I fear.</p>
<p>In comparison to other options out there it just blows them out of the water. There was one other option that was only in beta called beanflow.com that looked promising. However, I thought it might be a little cruel to set up the business on a system that was hardly even in private beta! Still, it did look promising. It had built in job tracking that I think might have been quite a nice feature to add in. Still, that said, we have asana.com for that and it&rsquo;s coping really really well with that just now.</p>
<p>Basically I&rsquo;d recommend vend. It&rsquo;s been really good and looks set to totally turn around another small business! However, I'd recommend you have a good grasp of CSV&rsquo;s and Mapping before you look into migrating over. SKU and barcode knowledge and the time to sort that out is also required to make it work at all.</p>
<p>In short, vend is yet another example that <em>we do not need to be married to</em> archaic native apps and pathetic licences.</p>
