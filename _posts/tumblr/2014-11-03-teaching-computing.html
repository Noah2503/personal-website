<p>This is a response to a <a href="http://computingandbusiness.blogspot.co.uk/2014/10/sqas-mistake.html" target="_blank">post</a> by a friend of mine, Alex Sharpe.</p>
<p>I agree with Alex on a basic level: a reduction in Computing courses in the SQA diet is a step in the wrong direction. I do however reject the idea that Information Systems was a really great subject and certainly wasn&rsquo;t one I feel in love with.</p>
<p>I think there should be two courses at the Higher and Advanced Higher Levels, but not Computing and Informations Systems. Here&rsquo;s my proposal:</p>
<p><strong>Course 1:</strong> Computer Science</p>
<ul><li><span>Combinatorics, Logic, Algebra taught in the context of Computing</span></li>
<li><span>Practical programming exercises on those topics</span></li>
<li><span>Relational Database theory and practical work in SQL only</span></li>
<li><span>Computer Architecture module (updated) ideally with hardware practical work</span></li>
<li><span>Expert Systems and AI</span></li>
</ul><p><strong>Course 2:</strong> Software Engineering</p>
<ul><li><span>Consists of a number of simple programming projects covering a broad range of topics, ideally with a basic business case covered in parallel e.g.</span></li>
</ul><ul><li><span>Console Application, perhaps with hardware integration</span></li>
<li><span>Web Application, further practical exposure to databases</span></li>
<li><span>Complied Desktop/Mobile application</span></li>
<li><span>Video Game</span></li>
</ul><ul><li><span>Source Control and Social Coding should be covered</span></li>
<li><span>The exam would have <em>minimal wight</em> and cover design patterns and working processes onlyÂ </span></li>
</ul><p>I feel this would cover the core areas of the existing Information Systems and Computing courses but also expose students to a greater &amp; more useful range of skills, topics and concepts.</p>
<p>This won&rsquo;t happen though, largely due to teaching hurdles. You would <strong>need</strong> to have CS Grads with a teaching certificate in <em>all</em> schools, and that&rsquo;s not going to happen.</p>
<p>Also, If you <strong><em>want</em></strong> to do business and computing, do business <em>AND</em> computing.</p>
