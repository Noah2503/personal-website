<p><br/>This is the first review I&rsquo;ve done on here for quite a while - here&rsquo;s my take on <a href="https://ifttt.com/" target="_blank">IFTTT</a>.<br/><br/><a class="g-profile" href="http://plus.google.com/109525093279809082285" target="_blank">+IFTTT</a> is an online automation service that brings together many online applications. Before I begin there is some IFTTT jargon that you should know:<br/><br/></p><ul><li>Channel: An application that you have &lsquo;linked&rsquo;.</li><li>Trigger: An event that a Channel has. <i>e.g. 'New Mail Recived&rsquo;.</i></li><li>Action: A task that a Channel can complete automatically.</li><li>Recipe: A combination of a Trigger and an Action.</li></ul><div>To give you a feel two of my current recipes are: Post a link to all my new blog posts on <a href="https://twitter.com/charlieegan3/status/293880685662437378" target="_blank">Twitter</a> and Add an event to my 'Places' calendar whenever I check in on <a href="https://foursquare.com/charlieegan3" target="_blank">Foursquare</a>. All the recipes I use are also used by others, there&rsquo;s a sharing feature, however I&rsquo;ve made modifications to suit. Custom recipes are also really easy to set up.</div><div><br/></div><div>I <a href="http://www.charlieegan3.com/2013/01/musical-menology.html" target="_blank">mentioned</a> not so long ago about logging my music - this system has some flaws. It only accounts for the dates the files were created and doesn&rsquo;t keep a log of every single track you play during a day. However, with the help of the last.fm and Google Drive APIs, I have now solved this problem with IFTTT. A simple Recipe is now triggered every time I play a song, it&rsquo;s action being to log the song, artist and time in a spreadsheet.</div><div><br/></div><div>There are a few minor issues with the service, but none come close to being major. </div><div><ul><li>It&rsquo;s only as good as the APIs it uses. By this I mean: If an API is weak, lacking in features or none existent (<a href="https://twitter.com/adamjwray/status/293896078686818304" target="_blank">Google+</a>) there is nothing you can really do. There are a few work arounds with 'Send and Email to Add&rsquo; features but they are often far from perfect and fail to accomplish anything close to the functionality of a powerful API.</li><li>Multi Action Recipes. Perhaps best explained with an example: I have three recipes where Blogger is the trigger, all with different actions. Surely it would be more efficient to group these? Say, when this happens, do these three things - that just seems more natural to me.</li><li>The site&rsquo;s interface is nice, however it should have a 'condensed view&rsquo; for viewing your recipes. It&rsquo;s as if they only ever expected people to have a handful of recipes. It would be nice to have a more tabular view available for those users with more recipes.</li></ul><div>If you&rsquo;ve read though this and still don&rsquo;t really understand what it&rsquo;s all about head <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5842307/how-to-supercharge-all-your-favorite-webapps-with-ifttt" target="_blank">here</a> or just head over to <a href="http://ifttt.com/" target="_blank">IFTTT</a> to&hellip;</div></div><blockquote class="tr_bq"><i>Put the Internet to work for you.</i></blockquote><br/><b>-charlie out-</b>
