<p><br/>I quite like to know when someone reads a message I send them. I also like the idea that they can see that I&rsquo;ve read their message and should expect a reply. I used to use read receipts in my email a long time ago but they were wrong so much of the time that I just stopped bothering. Facebook now has this feature, and, while I spend as little time on Facebook as I can, I have to admit that this is a good addition.<br/><br/>It&rsquo;s also helpful to know when people have seen posts in groups too - it&rsquo;s nice to get a feel for the amount of interest in a post. This feature allows you to gauge the response purely by taking an estimate at the ratio of views to comments and likes.<br/><br/>While I like it for my messages too I can see why you might not, I think that Facebook should give you the option to disabled it but they don&rsquo;t, so you can use <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fb-unseen/ihcedcpmfdpjijiamkaeaefgfagnnpei/details?hl=en" target="_blank">this</a> extension instead. After all it is a bit of an invasion of privacy.<br/><br/><b>-charlie out-</b></p>
