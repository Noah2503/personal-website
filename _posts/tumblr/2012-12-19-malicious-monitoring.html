<p><br/>When you visited this site the link that brought you here tracked your exit and I tracked your entrance. Google gives website owners the <a href="https://www.google.com/analytics/" target="_blank">tools</a> to monitor the traffic related to their sites.<br/><br/>I can tell when the site was visited; if it was visited by you before, and how many pages you loaded. I can tell what browser you used; what your operating system is; who hosts your internet connection and where they say you are. This allows me to test my site for various different usage types to make sure it works for everyone - it's essential for a frustration free web.<br/><br/>I see why this is good, why it's necessary and how it&rsquo;s all just part of the service Google provides. But because it doesn&rsquo;t tell you that you are being logged after every page load the older generation is surprisingly put off by this.<br/><br/>Of course Google can use this information for show you <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/adsense" target="_blank">ads</a>. We all understand that this is all part of the internet but to some older folk this personalized advertising seems scary, a little big brother like.<br/><br/>People just need to learn that this is the way that the internet works - they can easily block ads if they want to. Google isn&rsquo;t out there to sell your soul they&rsquo;re just funding their free service.<br/><br/>There are ways to stop it if you really hate it that much though, take a look into: <a href="https://www.torproject.org/" target="_blank">Tor</a>, and <a href="http://adblockplus.org/en/" target="_blank">AdBlock</a>.<br/><br/>This ties well with a popular quote from a MetaFilter discussion in <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/95152/Userdriven-discontent#3256046" target="_blank">2010</a>.<br/></p><blockquote class="tr_bq">If you are not paying for it, you&rsquo;re not the customer; you&rsquo;re the product being sold.</blockquote>All I have to say is, that while that is profoundly true, it&rsquo;s a small price to pay and is easily avoided. It&rsquo;s the future and I think it&rsquo;s just a small part of what is ultimatly a good thing.<br/><br/><b>-charlie out-</b>
