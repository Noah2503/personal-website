<p><br/>One of the better general tech news sites out there is Hexus.net and <a href="http://hexus.net/ce/news/internet/49129-google-now-spread-wings-fly-chrome/" target="_blank">this</a> story is what sparked this post.<br/><br/>Google Now - <i>the</i> Siri Destroyer - is expected to branch into the chrome browser sometime soon. I think this would make a lot of sense.<br/><br/>I use Google Now <i>very </i>occasionally now on my phone, normally only when I&rsquo;m on my own and want to quickly get the number of somewhere, or make a call. It is very fast and does save me a little time every now and then. However I don&rsquo;t like talking to my phone in public, it there&rsquo;s just something odd about that - and it&rsquo;s something I worry about for Glass.<br/><br/>On my computer though i&rsquo;m nearly always alone, in my room. Being able to call out: &ldquo;Send Alex a new email&rdquo; would be handy, especially if it had a hotkey. There is however a major barrier here.<br/><br/>I like to use apps that aren&rsquo;t chrome. Yes, despite Google&rsquo;s desires, the best way to do lots of tasks is using an app other than chrome. This means that I would want to be able to access them with &lsquo;Now Chrome&rsquo; too. For example: 'Create a new text file here&rsquo;, or 'pause spotify&rsquo;.<br/><br/>With Google pushing for an all online world I, sadly, can&rsquo;t see this being included/one of it's capabilities. That said, even being able to automate the browser and Google apps would be a start.<br/><br/><b>-charlie out-</b></p>
