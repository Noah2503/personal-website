<p><br/>Startups and other small businesses make extensive use of free services like Gmail in their early days - this is great. It helps them get on their way, my questions is this: does it reflect badly on them if they continue to use them once they get underway?<br/><br/>Personally, think it does. Common examples would be having their own domain but <b>still</b> using a webmail address, or running their site with Tumblr. When a company is clearly more established this can make them look cheap and lazy. It just makes you wonder what else they might be cutting back on.<br/><br/>I bought this domain with an email hosting for £7.50, can that really be too high a price to pay?<br/><br/>There are some exceptions however. Twitter is kind of unique, there are no paid alternatives for that service. However, for a company to have Twitter but no domain is just&hellip;odd! It needs to help create referrals from the high profile Twitter space to their site - otherwise the doesn&rsquo;t seem to be much point.<br/><br/>Building a web presence has become particularly cheap and easy and important at the same time - I&rsquo;d say there&rsquo;s no longer any excuse.<br/><br/><b>-charlie out-</b></p>
