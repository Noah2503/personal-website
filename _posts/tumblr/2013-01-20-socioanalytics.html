<p><br/>Â I&rsquo;ve spent a little while on LinkedIn today, it&rsquo;s a good place with a job that&rsquo;s only going to become more important. One of the nice features that I only noticed today was the viewing stats. Freely available there you are told how many people viewed your page and how many people saw you in searches. For me anyway I&rsquo;d find it interesting to know what the traffic was like on my other profiles.<br/><br/>Some interesting statistics might be: (for Twitter)<br/>Per Profile: <br/></p><ul><li>Pageviews and Pageviews from search</li><li>Aggregates like Totals for Retweets and Favorites</li></ul>Per Tweet:<br/><ul><li>Seen by Total</li><li>Total content/image loads</li><li>Total Time on Screen</li><li>Total cancelled replies, quotes and retweets</li></ul>I think it&rsquo;s important that seeing as the information is public that the viewers are, at least by default, anonymous. However while doing so it would be nice to know a little about the traffic, for example by country, as is available in many other analytic tools.<br/><br/>There are many big players on social networks that I&rsquo;m sure would pay for features of this kind, that&rsquo;s certainly the way that LinkedIn has decided to do it and it seems to be working out over there.<br/><br/>While it&rsquo;s just a kind of &lsquo;out of interest&rsquo; thing for me I&rsquo;m sure such features would be well received and used by others.<br/><ul></ul><b>-charlie out-</b>
