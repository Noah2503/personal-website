<p><br/>I&rsquo;m mainly writing this for some friends over at <a href="http://www.enemies-everywhere.com/" target="_blank">Enemies Everywhere</a>, It&rsquo;s a gaming blog and I offered to do a guest post. This is it:<br/><br/>I&rsquo;ve covered multiplayer gaming <a href="http://www.charlieegan3.com/2012/12/coequal-contestants.html" target="_blank">before</a> - sadly, it's something that &rsquo;s held back by so many gripes it&rsquo;s often hard to know where to start. I made the point that there are some aspects that need more attention. Today I&rsquo;ll cover some things that distract from the real work towards the perfect shooter.<br/><br/>Customization is the first snag, it sits forever at the figurehead of marketing campaigns purely because it&rsquo;s easy to sell. It&rsquo;s easy to show off the variety of the new weapons, perks and power-ups you&rsquo;ve coded   in, really easy. Thanks to this they have been moved to pole position and are often all that is talked about the new game. You can&rsquo;t blame developers for this and there have been some really original and noteworthy specimens from this cycle. However I think it is <i>taking up too much time</i> and is only obscuring from problems closer to the core of the system being sold.<br/><br/>Graphics is next on the hit list. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, the work on high end graphics is making the world a better place not only for your eyes but for <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/object/what-is-gpu-computing.html" target="_blank">science</a><span id="goog_1372401158"></span><span id="goog_1372401159"></span><a href="http://www.blogger.com/" target="_blank"></a> too. It&rsquo;s crucial that we keep improving our graphical technologies, both hardware and software, but I feel they bear little relevance when it comes to multiplayer shooters. Sure we don&rsquo;t want to run around an untextured world but we&rsquo;re aiming for 0 lag with a high frame rate and complex meshes don&rsquo;t help and seriously hinder dated console performance. High end graphics should remain the forefront of PC gaming, fantastic emersive campaigns and sandboxes are what people <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Witcher_2:_Assassins_of_Kings" target="_blank">want</a>. However to expect the same visuals in the other-worldly multiplayer space would be naive.<br/><br/>The dream of the multitalented game. All games have a speciality - some have great stories, some have huge replay value, but none have consistent acclaim in all play spaces. I say games stick to what they&rsquo;re good at. Appealing to the wider demographic with secondary many modes is a cheap trick. Just because a game has an extra mode doesn&rsquo;t make it worth playing. In my opinion Call of Duty&rsquo;s campaign and Mass Effect 3&rsquo;s multiplayer are prime examples of this. These again are distractions, and subtract from rather than building great games.<br/><br/><b>-charlie out-</b></p>
