<p><br/></p><div class="p1">Yes, another phablet post, it&rsquo;s something I see as having the potential to make big changes in the industry (and perhaps <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887324442304578236480316234780.html?mod=WSJ_hp_EditorsPicks&amp;utm_source=buffer&amp;buffer_share=5e4bd" target="_blank">fashion</a>!). I&rsquo;ve got the Galaxy Note 2, the first majorly successful device in the category - it&rsquo;s been the perfect device for me and it's largely to thank for the success of the category as a whole.<br/><br/>This Samsung branded <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/technology/2013/01/samsung_how_the_korean_firm_got_to_be_the_biggest_tech_company_in_the_world.html" target="_blank">success</a> is starting to really generate competition, others are starting to take notice, and <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/02/10/iphablet-ipad-mini-retina-apple-rumors_n_2647684.html" target="_blank">recent</a> <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2013/02/13/apples-4-8-inch-iphone-6-reportedly-not-launching-until-mid-2014/" target="_blank">rumours</a> would have us believe that includes big Apple.<br/><br/>An Apple phablet is a thrilling prospect. This is what I predict it will need to succeed while fitting in with Apple&rsquo;s current range of mobile devices:<br/><br/><ul><li><i>5&quot; Retina Display</i> - this is a must, to achieve a similar volume of screen content as the note 2 but in a smaller form factor.</li><li>Stylus not required - however a means to achieve some &lsquo;higher level&rsquo; editing features like annotations would be important. Samsung should be implementing Air View with a finger soon so that&rsquo;s a possibility.</li><li>Revised iOS - without this it simply wont work. iOS needs to take on more forms and phablets need one of them.</li><ul><li>True Multitasking</li><li>Side-by-Side App Windows</li><li>Editing and Annotation Features</li></ul></ul><div>There are also a few features such as a better share feature that I personally feel should be in all versions of iOS - but that&rsquo;s a different list.</div><div><br/></div><div>If Apple do venture into the phablet market it needs to be early 2014 at the latest. If it&rsquo;s not sorted before then Samsung&rsquo;s phablet experience might be too much to topple with a new take on the walled garden. </div><div><br/></div><div>Apple - I wish you luck.</div></div><br/><div class="p1"></div><br/><br/><b>-charlie out-</b>
