<p><br/>I&rsquo;d been quite <a href="http://www.charlieegan3.com/2012/12/keymonk-keyboard.html" target="_blank">vocal</a> about my previous keyboard Keymonk. It was really great and it felt like a truly innovative product. A few weeks ago I read <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5974067/swype-adds-crowd+sourced-dictionaries-for-better-word-prediction?tag=android-downloads" target="_blank">this</a> and decided it was time for a change once again. Swype had been the keyboard of choice before Keymonk and now it&rsquo;s back.<br/><br/>I think what I really want however is a mix of the two.<br/><br/>From Keymonk I want the two finger capability - I see that is a big plus point. It just seems so odd that when you Swype you have to start only using one finger? Especially when you can use two on all the others! Keymonk also allows swiping to remove whole words which is a really useful feature. Keymonk also looks better - in my opinion - and is certainly easier to discover and install. I&rsquo;m not really sure why Swype isn&rsquo;t on Google Play.<br/><br/>Swype however has the key feature for a sloppy typist - accuracy. Yes, it turns my wild swipes into words better than any other option out there. It's predictive options and integration are also a plus point. Recently it&rsquo;s also gained the third party libraries making it even more accurate.<br/><br/>So this marks the start of a session with Swype. However, I&rsquo;ll remain on the lookout for a keyboard that  allows me to:<br/><br/></p><ul><li>Utilize my dual thumb ability</li><li>Correct my sloppy swipes across the screen</li><li>And is reliable and regularly updated</li></ul><br/><b>-charlie out-</b>
