<p><br/></p><div class="p1">This is again a suggested feature for mobile phones. It&rsquo;s not likely to save the same number of lives as yesterdays but it would be a nice feature all the same.</div><div class="p2"><br/></div><div class="p1">The background: phones get notifications. Lots of them, messages, interactions, emails and so on. Lots of these, namely emails and interactions you get while on your computer too. </div><div class="p2"><br/></div><div class="p1">The problem: you are &lsquo;over-notified&rsquo; of updates whilst at your computer.</div><div class="p2"><br/></div><div class="p1">The fix: implement a mode called: 'Proximity Ignore&rsquo;.</div><div class="p2"><br/></div><div class="p1">This feature would be user controllable but also have the option of 'sensing&rsquo; you were at your computer. This might be done by:</div><div class="p1">-Setting a Wifi network that was where you use your computer</div><div class="p1">-Noticing that you weren&rsquo;t moving with GPS</div><div class="p1">-Noticing that the phone wasn&rsquo;t been used to check the time.</div><div class="p1">-Setting 'Computer Use&rsquo; hours in settings</div><div class="p1">-'Spotting&rsquo; your laptop on Bluetooth</div><div class="p1">…</div><div class="p2"><br/></div><div class="p1">This would mean an end to the annoying 'over-notification&rsquo; problem and the endless flashing LED&rsquo;s that follow.</div><b><br/></b><b>-charlie out-</b>
