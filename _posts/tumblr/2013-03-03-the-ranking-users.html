<p><br/>One of the problems with online systems, one that I find particularly interesting, is the ranking of users. How a user progresses their membership, and how you use that data.<br/><br/>Not all sites openly display a users rank, most still rank users in the background, but I&rsquo;m interested in the systems that make ranks visible. Common examples would be forums, Foursquare check-ins + badges and I suppose tweets and followers to an extent. These are all numbers that show the level of engagement with the site and this information can be very useful.<br/><br/>Displaying such information to users allows them to formulate behaviors towards each other.<br/><br/>Certainly in forums this is very important - I know it is at macrumors.com. Your rank and the time you&rsquo;re been a member is often what an argument boils down to. It also effects the way in which people respond to you and your posts - it&rsquo;s quite interesting really.<br/><br/>Foursquare check-ins are more for fun, you don&rsquo;t respect someone with more you just get on with it. Still there are leader boards to help stimulate a little competition. Twitter is an odd one here, there aren&rsquo;t any clear rankings but people certainly note the number of followers or tweets a user has. In many ways the ratio of these figures helps you formulate your initial opinion of that user.<br/><br/>In conclusion I think these little &lsquo;Social Scores&rsquo; help keep users interested and competing - getting them right can really make a service great.<br/><br/><b>-charlie out-</b></p>
