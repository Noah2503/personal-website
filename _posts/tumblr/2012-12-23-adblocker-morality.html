<p><br/>In June of next year I will hopefully be able to get <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/adsense" target="_blank">AdSense</a> on my site. To get access you need 6 months of time adding content. I imagine it will pay out next to nothing - In fact I&rsquo;m certain of it. There isn&rsquo;t likely to be enough traffic even by then, still I&rsquo;m keen to give it a go. Hopefully things will still be happening here in June.<br/><br/>Anyway this topic brings me on to a more interesting one. I currently use <a href="http://adblockplus.org/en/" target="_blank">Adblock Plus</a> and thanks to that I just don&rsquo;t see ads. This is great if you&rsquo;re on a slow connection like I am - it means less waiting time. That said, I think that it is our job as web users to at least look at the adds to keep the free services we use up and running.<br/><br/>Many of these services, like my <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/" target="_blank">favorite forum site</a>, are funded almost completely by AdSense revenue.  If we want to keep using these <i>free</i> services then we are going to have to keep loading the ads.<br/><br/>I&rsquo;m not really sure how I think ads should be handled on the internet - it&rsquo;s a difficult one. I think the more intelligent the ads are the better - I&rsquo;m never going to click on instant fat or wrinkle removal. I think all ads need to be a little more tailored and relevant to the user.<br/><br/>I will pay to remove ads, I&rsquo;ll get a &lsquo;premium account&rsquo; where I feel it's appropriate. Just donating to Adblock doesn&rsquo;t feel quite right!<br/><br/><b>-charlie out-</b></p>
