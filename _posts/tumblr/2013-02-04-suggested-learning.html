<p><br/>This time last year I was in the process of getting in to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_XNA" target="_blank">XNA</a> with C# on PC, it was how I spent my spare time back then. Year year I&rsquo;ve spending a large amount of time with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_on_Rails" target="_blank">Ruby on Rails</a>. I&rsquo;d say that in many ways I&rsquo;m enjoying rails more - partly because I can see how it includes a broader skill set (HTML, CSS, JavaScript&hellip;). I&rsquo;m finding it harder to learn though - much harder in fact. There is a need to be continually connected to the internet just to look up the syntax and error messages that come with every minute of work. With C# I didn&rsquo;t have a <a href="http://www.charlieegan3.com/2012/12/programming-by-paperback.html" target="_blank">book</a> but I did have Visual Studio.<br/><br/>Visual Studio has one <b>big</b> bonus over my <a href="http://www.charlieegan3.com/2012/12/sublime-service.html" target="_blank">current</a> <a href="http://macrabbit.com/espresso/" target="_blank">setup</a> - <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autocomplete#In_source_code_editors" target="_blank">code completion</a></i>.<br/><br/>This made experimentation as a learner a huge amount more successful. It would always be guessing at what you might want to do - working away to beat you to it. This not only made it faster when you&rsquo;d got the idea but it helped enormously when you didn&rsquo;t quite know what you were doing. As long as you got the start right it would often point out the rest (with the help of some educated guessing).<br/><br/>In terms of the languages themselves there&rsquo;s very little in it - they are quite similar to look at (although I would say that I find C# more readable). It&rsquo;s just the tools available that set them apart. I&rsquo;m getting to grips with it but I think that it will be a little while before I can write my own code rather than just adjusting and piecing together code from various tutorials.<br/><br/><b>-charlie out-</b></p>
