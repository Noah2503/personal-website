<blockquote class="tr_bq"><br/>&lsquo;50 have you in circles&rsquo;</blockquote>They don&rsquo;t that&rsquo;s just a goal, by the end of the year kind of thing.<br/><br/>I&rsquo;d <a href="http://www.charlieegan3.com/2013/01/social-service.html" target="_blank">mentioned</a> that my closer friends had migrated to using Google+ over the last year and I&rsquo;ve kind of tagged along. It&rsquo;s grown on me though, it&rsquo;s really well thought out and has some really smart features.<br/><br/>My favorite would be the Android App, I know it&rsquo;s not really a feature so to speak, but it is a key part in making it work so well for me. As an example, we went to have a meal at a <a href="https://plus.google.com/102830479477024164539/about?gl=uk&amp;hl=en" target="_blank">local italian</a> before we all went home for Christmas. We had sorted it out as an 'Event&rsquo; and everything. Once we were there and the event had 'started&rsquo; all my photos were automatically uploaded to the event page. This was just so seamless that it more than deserves the 1st mention.<br/><br/>I also really like the way that, on the most basic level, the posting system works. I, as the original poster, have total control over my content, much like I do here on my blog, but with a few extra options included. You can block sharing, choose who sees it, who get notified by email, how comments work, delete comments and so on. All of these options allow me to use the site in the best way that suites me, it can be like twitter, facebook or a blog and all at the same time too - I think that&rsquo;s quite special really.<br/><br/>Hangouts also deserve a mention, Skype charges for these kind of services, so, in some ways it&rsquo;s been a welcome feature for us rather cheap students. However I find that they have a tendency to sink to nonsense really quickly and can end up being a colossal waste of time.<br/><br/>While I&rsquo;m not alone on this one, it&rsquo;s far from unanimous, I think it would be better if I had more than a handful of people in my circles and vice versa. Though some of the others on there right now enjoy that it&rsquo;s sort of 'our own private playground&rsquo; of social space, and wish to keep it that way.<br/><br/><b>-charlie out-</b>
