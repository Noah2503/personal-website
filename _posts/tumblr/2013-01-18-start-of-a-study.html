<p><br/>Before taking up my degree I spent a great deal of time trying to <a href="http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=1350137" target="_blank">researching</a> the value of a CS degree. I asked family members in the industry and spent a great deal of time online. While every one of my friends ploughed into university full force, stating that it was <i>without a doubt</i> the best thing to do - it may be for them, but I wasn&rsquo;t convinced - I&rsquo;m still not convinced.<br/><br/>However I came to the point where I decided I was going and in September moved to <a href="http://www.abdn.ac.uk/" target="_blank">Aberdeen</a>.<br/><br/>While most of the time I&rsquo;ve been thinking about my studies, sadly the doubt remained, even been reinforced. Now that I&rsquo;m here I have a little more to balance up. My aim is to get into relevant work and the university question has become all about time and money. I&rsquo;m spending four years and over £5000 pounds a year to get this degree - but is it worthwhile?<br/><br/>On the money side I was almost decided that it, was in fact, worth it, it costs a great deal more in England and the student loan is a real gift. However, I can&rsquo;t help but notice a discrepancy. Most of the people who gave me advice were older than me, and I think degree courses might have changed. That has become my new question. I get around 14 hours of contact time per week, asking my parents though they seem to have had a great deal more than that. I&rsquo;m going to ask around to get a better idea on this - I&rsquo;m suspicious that students today get significantly less teaching and much poorer value for money.<br/><br/>The other question is one harder to research: Is a CS degree really the best way to train computing professionals? While I&rsquo;m far from qualified to answer it, the question remains. This is an opinion that I&rsquo;m prepared to alter but, from what I can tell it&rsquo;s not - far from it even.<br/><br/>I do four courses - one, Management is not directly relevant and is more of a prep course for a Management degree which is largely psychological. The rest are my three CS courses. Personally I think that only one, Web Application Development, teaches<i> </i>any<i> real skills</i> - the others are interesting all the same. We use real tools and learn the basics to real peoples jobs - it&rsquo;s seems obviously the most useful.<br/><br/>This brings me to my point. If it&rsquo;s the practical courses that are perhaps the most useful then wouldn&rsquo;t those skills be better taught on the job, in the world of work? Computer science can still be an option, but I&rsquo;m currently in need of some explaining as to why it has to be the <i>only</i> option.<br/><br/><b>-charlie out-</b></p>
