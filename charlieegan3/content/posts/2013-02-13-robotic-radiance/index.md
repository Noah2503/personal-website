title: Automatic brightness adjustment doesn't work yet

Devices are getting smarter and this helps us most of the time. However, My
phone and laptop both have a disabled setting in common: _Automatically Adjust
Brightness_. It _should_ be a useful feature. It’s not for me - and seems
to only create a distraction. When you’re sitting still it’s fine (perfectly
still) - it may even count as useful. However as soon as you move around the
display practically flashes to compensate for what is _perceives_ as new
lighting conditions.

It’s the rate of change that’s the problem - at least slow it a little! The
controller for this feature seems happy to make swinging adjustments almost
continuously. I need some more options:

* The option to set boundaries on the variation. For example don’t set at
  greater than 80% or less than 20%.
* Also a setting on the sensitivity - just the option to tone down the rapid
  reactions a little. Only after a significant change in lighting make the
  change.
* Rate of Change. The setting to reduce the maximum 'speed’ at which the
  brightness can change. Set lower this would hopefully give a
  more gradual adjustment in brightness and in turn be less distracting.
* The option to **turn it off** is the also essential - lets hope it stays.
