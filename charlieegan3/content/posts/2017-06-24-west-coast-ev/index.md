I've been working on [char.gy](https://char.gy) for the last few months. I fear
it may be becoming all consuming as I felt compelled to write up our EV centric
holiday...

At either end of a week long stay in South Uist we drove this route in our
Renault Zoe:

* `A` **Home in Muir of Ord**
* `B` Inverness Cathedral Car Park
* `C` Drumnadrochit Tourist Info
* `D` Fort William Lidl
* `E` Mallaig Ferry Terminal Car Park
* `F` Lochboisdale *(no charger)*
* `G` **Howmore (holiday cottage for a week)**
* `H` Liniclate School
* `I` Berneray *(no charger)*
* `J` Leverburgh Harbour Car Park
* `K` Tarbert Ferry Office Car Park
* `L` Stornoway Council Car Park
* `M` Ullapool Ferry Terminal Car Park

Between E & F, I & J and L & M there are ferry journeys.

Some notes on charge points:

* Poor signal makes validating RFID cards slow.
* Multiple charge points actually worked that were labeled as faulty. (I guess
  people failed to get them to work or they started working again)
* When you're using the car driving about on holiday you need a 22kw+ charger,
  anything longer takes too long to be useful.
* All the chargers seemed to be EVOLT (APT Technologies, Circontrol Software)
* All the chargers were free for us to use with a
  [chargeplacescotland.org](http://chargeplacescotland.org/) RFID card. Charge
  Your Car Stickers were also there for English drivers.
