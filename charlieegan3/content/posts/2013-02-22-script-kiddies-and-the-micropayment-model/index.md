I about a week ago I read a an
[article](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-21371609) on by BBC on Script
Kiddies cheating Microtransation systems in games. I found the story
annoying for a number of reasons. The first was the way that ‘offenders’ were
discussed.

First off, C# and Visual Basic can be used to make complex systems. I fail to
see how the readability syntax has any meaning here - bear in mind these
languages may have been the only/most accessible way to implement such a tool.
That doesn’t make them 'basic’ - MSDN would lap up that tone…

The _11 year old kids_ made mistakes professional programmers with CS degrees
and years of experience were unlikely to make. Isn’t this a surprise? 11 year
old kids make mistakes in spoken English too and we don’t turn our noses up at
that.

Okay, digital products can be replicated an infinite number of times - they
have no manufacturing costs.  While it is perhaps wrong that they can get stuff
for free it also brings into question: should developers be able to sell
content in this way? This is up for debate and is currently a subject
I'm undecided on.

I think what is damaging about the article through is it gives kids interested
in programming a bad name, a reason to be watched and worried over. While it’s
not as good as making a website or an app, you’ve got to start somewhere, and
the skills learned will eventually benefit the industry.
