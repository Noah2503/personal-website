It’s been over three weeks now and it’s starting to fall into a regular pattern, here’s some highlights from this week online.[News Article](http://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2012/12/valves-definitely-making-a-steam-box-and-its-going-to-take-on-the-ps4-and-xbox/) (Source: Gizmodo)

> Valve won’t be the only Steam Box manufacturer, apparently, which means there should be many more generically PC-based options out there, just running Steam.
An interesting development that should help mix things up a little in the gaming sphere. Hopefully it will give PC gaming a route into the mass market. The idea that there would be many manufactures of is an interesting one, this could be great if handled well. One of the nice things about consoles is the equally of platform - this would clearly change this - and i’m not sure that's necessarily a good thing.

This is certainly an interesting prediction, an interesting list - watch these ones. It’s going to be really interesting where some of these things end up. The most interesting to me is where chip manufacture settles over the next few years, that’s going to be a big one.

This is a topic i’ve yet to get round to covering from a personal perspective, take a look at these stats, some very interesting ones in there. I’ve mentioned quite a few times about covering the Android iOS argument, expect a post by christmas.

This made a good point and seemed particular relevant to me as a student. It’s all about being sufficiently prepared to achieve your ideal plan.

I would have loved something like this when I was young, I’m forever going to be chased by these kids who got a head start. Good luck to them.

This has been quite nice to have for some particularly annoying mobile ads. Doesn’t seem to be as reliable as the web version though.
