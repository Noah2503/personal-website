I’m sure most of you are familiar with giving ‘IT support’ to family members and friends. I’ve recently arrived home for Christmas and not having to do this quite a relief. There’s something fundamentally challenging about helping someone out over the phone.

I’ve tried everything. Making it really easy to use, going over everything they need to do and helping write lists of steps. I’ve tried [TeamViewer](http://www.teamviewer.com/en/index.aspx) and other methods of remote support but even they don’t seem to be much help a lot of the time.

It seems for me, and the people I have to help, that there is just no alternative to being there. Everything is just so much faster for all involved. It amazes me how call centers ever help anyone out sometimes.

This leads me on to another thought. Apple continually gets very high ratings for customer support and after sales care. They’re also one of the few companies where walking into the store is feasible from almost anywhere. Maybe the support that they can offer at the store is of such a high standard because it is fundamentally easier to offer help in this way. Not only can the staff better see the problem but the user can better explain it too.

Apple continues to [roll out more](http://www.macrumors.com/2012/12/14/apples-new-causeway-bay-retail-store-in-hong-kong-unveiled/) and more stores by the month and while I’m sure there are sales advantages too I have a feeling that they know fine well that the support these stores offer is a major selling point.

My question though is how long will it say this way? I don’t really have to help many people my own age, and when I do It’s generally just a quick pointer. As the 'Connected Generation’ grows older they aren’t going to need the same level of support. Will we still need to be face to face for this task in years to come?****charlie
