Now that I’m back at university after the Christmas break and starting the
second term I’m reminded of the incredible number of different systems (and log
ins) I have to use. There is one system per main function yet they are in
completely different places. I give you: ‘The University of Aberdeen Portal
System!’.

* First up is the main student portal, it’s the one you get from the search:
  'Aberdeen student portal’. Despite being the easiest to find and described as
  the main one it is used the least. It’s capable of showing you your exam
  timetable, exam results and advisory meetings - that’s all. Here you log in
  with a Student ID, Username and Password.
* MyAberdeen is what should be the main one. It contains the majority of our
  learning materials and is where we get _some_ of our coursework grades. It’s
  kept reasonably up to date but is not directly accessible from a Google
  search and so is harder to find. It’s also the place for end of unit tests
  and coursework submissions. For submissions it’s all good but the buggy
  blackboard software used for tests really lets it down. Here you _only_ need
  a Username and Password to log in.
* The second most important place is where your time table is, it’s called 'My
  Courses’. It’s impossible to find on a Google search and is located at:
  /mycourses.php - you can bookmark it or type that in each time. It’s where
  you sign up for practical and tutorial sessions and view your weekly time
  table. Some other course work marks are given here. You need a Username and
  Password to log in.
* The library system is also separate. Amazingly used for accessing papers and
  books. A Username and Password and DoB are needed to log in.
* There is also a separate system from the library system for distributing past
  papers. You must again use a Username and Password to Log in.
* Student Email is the final one. I almost forgot it thanks to the wonders of
  IMAP. It again is totally separate and is accessed with the email address and
  a different password.

That’s all the systems that are needed for studying, there are some extra ones
associated with payments and accommodation.

* eAccommodation is used to view your contract and invoices for your
  accommodation. It’s where you report faults and sign things related to all
  things bed. It however is not the same place where you pay for the room, ohh
  no that would make just too much sense. You need a Student ID, (different)
  Password and DoB (is a different format) to log in here.
* ePayments the final system I have to use requires a Student ID, Password and
  DoB to log in. It’s relatively simple after that though to make payments.

Now, I’m wondering if it might be simpler to have _one_ log in combination and
_one_ portal for all of that - would it be so hard?
