Startups and other small businesses make extensive use of free services like Gmail in their early days - this is great. It helps them get on their way, my questions is this: does it reflect badly on them if they continue to use them once they get underway?

Personally, think it does. Common examples would be having their own domain but **still** using a webmail address, or running their site with Tumblr. When a company is clearly more established this can make them look cheap and lazy. It just makes you wonder what else they might be cutting back on.

I bought this domain with an email hosting for £7.50, can that really be too high a price to pay?

There are some exceptions however. Twitter is kind of unique, there are no paid alternatives for that service. However, for a company to have Twitter but no domain is just…odd! It needs to help create referrals from the high profile Twitter space to their site - otherwise the doesn’t seem to be much point.

Building a web presence has become particularly cheap and easy and important at the same time - I’d say there’s no longer any excuse.
