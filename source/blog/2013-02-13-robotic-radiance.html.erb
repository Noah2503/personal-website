<p>Devices are getting smarter and this helps us most of the time. My phone and laptop both have a disabled setting in common: <em>Automatically Adjust Brightness</em>.True - it <em>should </em>be a useful feature. It’s not for me - and seems to only create a distraction.When you’re sitting still it’s fine (perfectly still) - it may even count as useful. However as soon as you move around the display practically flashes to compensate for what is <em>perceives</em> as new lighting conditions.It’s the rate of change that’s the problem - at least dampen it a little! The controller for this feature seems happy to make swinging adjustments almost continuously. This might work for some people’s lives but seems to be totally wonky in mine. I need some more settings:</p>
<ul>
<li>The option to set boundaries on the variation. For example don’t set at greater than 80% or less than 20%.</li>
<li>Also a setting on the sensitivity - just the option to tone down the rapid reactions a little. Only after a significant change in lighting make the change.</li>
<li>Rate of Change. The setting to reduce the maximum 'speed’ at which the brightness can change. Set lower this would hopefully give a more gradual adjustment in brightness and in turn be less distracting.</li>
<li>The option to <strong>turn it off</strong> is the also essential - thankfully this seems to be common place.</li>
</ul>
