<p><br/>Devices are getting smarter and this helps us most of the time. My phone and laptop both have a disabled setting in common: <i>Automatically Adjust Brightness</i>.<br/><br/>True - it <i>should </i>be a useful feature. It&rsquo;s not for me - and seems to only create a distraction.<br/><br/>When you&rsquo;re sitting still it&rsquo;s fine (perfectly still) - it may even count as useful. However as soon as you move around the display practically flashes to compensate for what is <i>perceives</i> as new lighting conditions.<br/><br/>It&rsquo;s the rate of change that&rsquo;s the problem - at least dampen it a little! The controller for this feature seems happy to make swinging adjustments almost continuously. This might work for some people&rsquo;s lives but seems to be totally wonky in mine. I need some more settings:<br/><br/></p><ul><li>The option to set boundaries on the variation. For example don&rsquo;t set at greater than 80% or less than 20%.</li><li>Also a setting on the sensitivity - just the option to tone down the rapid reactions a little. Only after a significant change in lighting make the change.</li><li>Rate of Change. The setting to reduce the maximum 'speed&rsquo; at which the brightness can change. Set lower this would hopefully give a more gradual adjustment in brightness and in turn be less distracting.</li><li>The option to <b>turn it off</b> is the also essential - thankfully this seems to be common place.</li></ul><br/><b>-charlie out-</b>
