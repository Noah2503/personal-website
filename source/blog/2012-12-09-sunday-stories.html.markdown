Just for a bit of variation, Sunday’s entry will be a collection of links to things that interested me this week.

[News Article](http://online.wsj.com/article_email/SB10001424127887323717004578159481472653460-lMyQjAxMTAyMDAwNDEwNDQyWj.html) (source: WSJ)

> “The adult way to run a business is to run it more like a country. They have disputes, yet they’ve actually been able to have huge trade with each other. They’re not sending bombs at each other.”

The media portrays these conflicts in a very skewed manner and I think this comment probably lies closer to the truth.

> “Humans disagree, and that’s what fuels the raging online communities, political systems, wars and sporting events. It’s our difference potential and it creates social energy.”

As a big believer in leaving (and reading) feedback this one interested me. It’s probably changed the way I’ll read and write feedback in future.

It sure would be great to see all this stuff by the time I’m 50 - an intriguing insight into the future of science an tech.

The idea of leaving (and forgetting about) a note for the future is another interesting one - I’ve set one up for my birthday next year.

Personally I use [Keymonk](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.keymonk.latin&hl=en) on my phone but this looked interesting in much the same way - if you’ve got an Android tablet it would be one to [try out](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.istastech.android.slicekeyboarddemo&feature=more_from_developer).

I change my desktop roughly once a week, this is the current on.
