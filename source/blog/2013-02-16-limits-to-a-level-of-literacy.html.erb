<p>Had I started this blog whilst still at school this topic is all I would have discussed. It’s not something that really effects me a huge amount now, however I think it’s still an important and interesting topic.</p>
<p>I’ll first describe how things worked at <a href="http://www.dingwallacademy.com/" target="_blank">Dingwall Academy</a>, my secondary school. There was a proxy server that all web traffic went through - it ran <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Websense" target="_blank">Websense</a>. The same filtering software ran on the servers at Guantanamo Bay. It’s configuration blocked much of the useful internet. This was a constant pain for us students and there was much time spent bribing supply teachers for their logins (the only way we could get round the problem!). It wasn’t just illegal or inappropriate content that was blocked, oh no, that would make just too much sense.</p>
<p>The level of filter must have been set to max for every category. There was no <em>Japan</em> in geography and no <em>pixels</em> in computing. Risqué terms like that never made it through. It wasn’t the keywords that were the problem, it was more the broader category blocks such as: forums, youtube and webmail that were the problem.</p>
<p>Some of these categories could have provided some very useful information for many of my subjects - but such a resource may as well have not existed (at school).</p>
<p>The one that bothered me the most was the “message boards and forums”. Under this category were: Stackoverflow and MSDN - two crucial resources for a 6th year entry level programmer. It would have been useful at times to have access to youtube as well - all were locked down like they were the pages of criminals.</p>
<p>I think this failure of a system came about from a fundamental lack of understanding in two areas: the internet at a resource, the nature of skills taught in some subjects (namely computing in my case).</p>
<p>It was clear to see how blocking tactic that had been employed - it might as well have been a whitelist it was that bad. Someone had thought of everyplace that a pupil <em>could</em> waste time and just blocked it without any consideration as to what good could and would come from the resource. YouTube is the perfect example here, true it’s a top spot for time wasting but the number of educational videos or videos of internet is staggering. In the same way it’s up to the teacher to stop pupils chatting it’s up to them to stop time wasting online. The blanket blocking can take innocent casualties too, like MSDN. Few waste time there and those that do should, perhaps, be encouraged to do so!</p>
<p>The other problem is that to know what not to block it’s important to understand the kinds of materials that are needed for each subject. Forums and discussion boards are key here. Programming basics rarely come from <a href="http://www.charlieegan3.com/2012/12/programming-by-paperback.html" target="_blank">books</a> anymore and tools like stackoverflow offer a much better problem orientated resource for those past the basics. To the untrained eye however it looks like a rather well built nerd chatroom - which in turn get’s it its blocked status. Tragic.</p>
<p>Now I visit stackoverlfow in excess of 10 times a day.</p>
<p>This is a message to those in secondary education: web developers have built you the internet - let’s allow that tool to support the developers of the future.</p>
