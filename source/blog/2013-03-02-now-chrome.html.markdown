One of the better general tech news sites out there is Hexus.net and [this](http://hexus.net/ce/news/internet/49129-google-now-spread-wings-fly-chrome/) story is what sparked this post.

Google Now - _the_ Siri Destroyer - is expected to branch into the chrome browser sometime soon. I think this would make a lot of sense.

I use Google Now _very _occasionally now on my phone, normally only when I’m on my own and want to quickly get the number of somewhere, or make a call. It is very fast and does save me a little time every now and then. However I don’t like talking to my phone in public, it there’s just something odd about that - and it’s something I worry about for Glass.

On my computer though i’m nearly always alone, in my room. Being able to call out: “Send Alex a new email” would be handy, especially if it had a hotkey. There is however a major barrier here.

I like to use apps that aren’t chrome. Yes, despite Google’s desires, the best way to do lots of tasks is using an app other than chrome. This means that I would want to be able to access them with ‘Now Chrome’ too. For example: 'Create a new text file here’, or 'pause spotify’.

With Google pushing for an all online world I, sadly, can’t see this being included/one of it's capabilities. That said, even being able to automate the browser and Google apps would be a start.
