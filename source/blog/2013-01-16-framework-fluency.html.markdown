Yesterday I posted a link to a video in my entry: _Programming Prodigy. _In the video [Santiago Gonzalez](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/01/03/santiago-gonzalez-prodigy-code_n_2404874.html) claims to be _fluent_ in several programming languages. This may be true, it’s good to learn in a broad fashion - however I would like to make a point.

Think about learning a programming language, what do you learn first? Variables, control flow, recursion all come in pretty quick. Also once you’ve put the time into learning one it’s really easy to pick up others. Languages are meant to be similar to make them easy to adopt. I would say this somewhat devalues the claim - the claim many non programmers won’t understand, perhaps even equate it to fluency several spoken languages. This is far from the truth, even languages in the same family share very little - while code syntax can be **very** similar. ([Source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexical_similarity#Indo-European_languages))

Does C, C#, Objective-C and Java count as four languages? Perhaps, but it’s still far less impressive than four spoken languages - even from the same family.

In my opinion it’s rather how the languages are used that we need to be looking to. As examples, where would Objective-C be without The Cocoa Framework, Ruby without Rails or C# with no .NET/XNA? It’s these frameworks and tools that make the languages valuable, desirable to learn.

It’s the same with spoken language, you may learn French to enjoy a holiday in France. French life and culture is the framework (with benefits) and French is the language that will help get you there.

However, when it comes to learning multiple frameworks it becomes more difficult to become_ ‘fluent in several’_. Because frameworks are often used to do specific task they tend to be rather specialised, focused, or aimed at a certain system. This results in, often complex, very different structures, much harder to pick up than languages themselves. For example the XNA framework used to support the Xbox and Windows Phone is going to be very different to RoR - purely due to the difference in purpose.

That was just an afterthought, a followup to the previous entry.
