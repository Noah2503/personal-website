Lots of big changes have just happened to land in 2012, moving out to university and so on. However, in terms of tech related changes, Social Networks have been the biggest change in my life this year.

I was an exceptionally late adopter of Facebook, I was one of, I think, two people in my year that didn’t have it. I missed it all, but don’t feel I’ve missed out. I ended up getting it to ‘stay in touch’ at the end of my final year, the truth of the matter is that it’s helped do nothing of the sort. Facebook is the noisiest place on earth, it buzzes with the most useless information and pathetic communications. For me though it was still the beginning of something - something more interesting.

Once I’d signed up I became curious, venturing out in the search of a better system. A system to network and fix the lack of any real online presence. I thought that it looked odd for someone so interested in the world of technology was invisible on a Google search, would that not raise questions? What has this guy got to hide? I set off in search of the perfect social mix.

[Twitter](https://twitter.com/charlieegan3) was the first stop and is has grown into my personal favorite  It seemed so very much cleaner in comparison to Facebook, and, while it wasn’t a substitute, it became a much better place to spend time. The other thing that appealed to me was the easy control of content associated with you. Tweets can fly at you but on your profile it’s only your content that appears, I liked that - being able to control ones public appearance with a dexterity Facebook lacked. That said, in the very beginning I didn’t tweet, I just followed individuals and online entities of interest - it became a bite sized news site, and it was that behaviour of the site that got me started. I did eventually follow other 'real people’ however only the ones I cared anything about - I do have the odd conversation on there be generally it’s just me in my tweets and I quite like it that way.
It only gathered momentum from there on - and lots happened all at once. On the 'online presence’ front [about.me](http://about.me/charlieegan3) was a quick stop. It was seemed quite a good place to create an online presence - just a simple page, bio and links - no real dynamic content to monitor I still keep my page up and running today however the about page here and the links at the side have all but made it pointless.

It stayed that way for quite a while - I didn’t bother with much else for quite a while. I kept on tweeting but was largely quiet on the others.

The next phase began on the 30th of November. This was the beginning of the blog, the beginning of charlieegan3.com. It started with Tumblr, Tumblr lasted for about ten days, it was going well and I have no complaints with the Tumblr service other than suboptimal SEO. It has the best UI and basics of any blogging service but Blogger.com and it’s greater Google integration pulled me off the Tumblr track.

The [.blogspot](http://charlieegan3.blogspot.com/) address only lasted so long - I was lead to believe that the lack of a private domain was a major turn off, this had to change. I bought charlieegan3.com on the 12/12/12 - blogger now does all my hosting for me. I saw £7 for the year as a really good deal and just went for it.

Another more recent change is the rise of Google+, it has been the 'playground’ of two of my close friends for a long while. Until recently I’ve sat very much on the side lines, just watching. It has become the main place for the discussion and arrangements for our little circle of friends. I see it as a quietened down Facebook with fantastic apps and features.

That brings me on to the topic of my mobile social networking. Twitter mobile is the best and is now the only place I really use it. Having Google+ photos on auto-upload is also a really nice feature and has been really good fun for the odd event.

So in summary this is how it stands as of the 31st of December 2012 (in order of usage):

* Twitter: _Microblog and news source with some minor interactions._
* Google+:_ Sharing and coordination with close friends._
* Blogger: _My technology related experiences and opinions._
* Facebook: _Communicating with classmates has become it’s sole purpose._
* LinkedIn: _Has a few connections but is mainly just left as a professional profile page._
* Foursquare: _Kind of an experimental one, with an opinion still under construction!_

So it would seem there is no perfect **one**, the perfect system for me has a been a bulky blend of **many** different options.

2012 has changed the online face of charlieegan3 for better and for always. 2013 here we come.
