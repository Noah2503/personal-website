This is a response to a [post](http://computingandbusiness.blogspot.co.uk/2014/10/sqas-mistake.html) by a friend of mine, Alex Sharpe.

I agree with Alex on a basic level: a reduction in Computing courses in the SQA diet is a step in the wrong direction. I do however reject the idea that Information Systems was a really great subject and certainly wasn’t one I feel in love with.

I think there should be two courses at the Higher and Advanced Higher Levels, but not Computing and Informations Systems. Here’s my proposal:

## Course 1: Computer Science

* Combinatorics, Logic, Algebra taught in the context of Computing
* Practical programming exercises on those topics
* Relational Database theory and practical work in SQL only
* Computer Architecture module (updated) ideally with hardware practical work
* Expert Systems and AI

## Course 2: Software Engineering

* Consists of a number of simple programming projects covering a broad range of topics, ideally with a basic business case covered in parallel e.g.

* Console Application, perhaps with hardware integration
* Web Application, further practical exposure to databases
* Complied Desktop/Mobile application
* Video Game

* Source Control and Social Coding should be covered
* The exam would have _minimal weight_ and cover design patterns and working processes only

I feel this would cover the core areas of the existing Information Systems and Computing courses but also expose students to a greater &amp; more useful range of skills, topics and concepts.

This won’t happen though, largely due to teaching hurdles. You would **need** to have CS Grads with a teaching certificate in _all_ schools, and that’s not going to happen.

Also, If you _want_ to do business and computing, do business _AND_ computing.
