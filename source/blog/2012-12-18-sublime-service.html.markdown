The problem of how to enforce licensing is a big one and one that certainly
deserves our attention. Many are trying new methods to license their products.
This is a short story about my experience with a fantastic program with an
interesting approach to the problem.

With the retina screen there are
only [certain apps](http://forums.macrumors.com/showpost.php?p=15359072&postcount=263)
that render text clearly. I was making heavy use of
[TextWrangler](http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/) but wanted
something that looked cleaner. I spent some time looking around and settled
with [Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/), it’s a clean editor
that rendered text well on the retina display.

I use the unregistered version, I didn’t want to buy it before testing it out
(a major flaw with the mac app store I hasten to add). It’s great, perfect even
for my [rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) projects. There is a sidebar that has
allows for project folders and each open file has tabs along the top. There
are many different colorings and some great little editing tools. However the
best thing about the software was the a customer support response.

I should first note my experiences with other developers. I
contacted [Guided Ways](https://www.2doapp.com/) and various other
developers only to be brushed off about a student license. In some ways this is
fine, smaller developers often only have one license type. With Sublime Text
though they were quite happy let me continue using the trial for the time
being.

While they still didn’t have a student license this response and the freedom of
an unlimited trail made me think much more of the program and company. It has
almost guaranteed that I will purchase the program in the near future.  I don’t
think this is a fix for every developer with every app but it’s certainly a
method that worked here. I wonder if there will ever be a complete answer to
the digital licensing issue.
