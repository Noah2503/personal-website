I’ve been down staying with relatives for the last few days. It’s nice to have a bit of variation, I quite like travelling about. One thing that is a little bit difficult though is keeping my [personal journal](http://dayoneapp.com/) and charlieegan3.com updated. I read an article on [lifehacker.com ](http://lifehacker.com/) quite a while a go now about how the longer you have done something the easier it is to keep doing it.

This definitely applies here and is quite a powerful force in keeping you rolling. When it gets to like this week though it can be rather inconvenient!

That said it’s a good thing that it works like this, I’ve been keeping the journal for almost for months now and the daily chain has been a big help in keeping the daily chain going.

It seems to be a kind of competition with ones past self. If you know that if in the past you managed then is becomes

It doesn’t matter if your chain is every hour, day or week. I’ve found it’s just important to keep it regular. I’ve tried doing some things just every now and then, but it really doesn't seem to work in the long term. - just far too easy to put off.

I know this isn’t strictly tech related but this is the kind of thing that I find interesting and useful. [lifehacker](http://lifehacker.com/) is a great site, if you’re not been already I’d take a look some time.
