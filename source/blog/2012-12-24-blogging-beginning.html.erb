<p>I’ve not been in the business long, still under a month in fact. In that short time I’ve learn’t my fair share of relevant knowledge, here are my…discoveries!</p>
<p>First up are the page-view misconceptions. Lesson: 400 americans did not visit my site in the first day. There were in fact just robots and I now use Analytics as a more accurate source of data.</p>
<p>AdSense was the next lesson. I applied 3 times for AdSense before finally putting in the time to find out that the site needs to be 6 months old. Not sure why Google can’t help you learn what is wrong with your application. Seems to be deliberately withholding on the matter.</p>
<p>I read through about 50 guides to increasing traffic but only one mentioned putting a link in your forum signature. Being a regular at <a href="http://forums.macrumors.com/member.php?u=669532" target="_blank">macrumors</a> this was a very easy step. I have over 2000 posts there, that means my signature is show in over 2000 places, so that’s 2000 visible links to my blog. It gets be about 20 unique visits a day - provided I post in a few threads. It also helps getting in early on the articles as they get the greatest traffic.</p>
<p>The other thing that is annoying but is something that I realized from the start - <em>I am in my stats</em>. A large percentage of my views are still from Aberdeen University, which of course is me. It was a big problem at the start for stat bending but now my have tailed off it’s a little better.</p>
<p>I’m sure there are many more lessons to learn on the blogging front - I just hope they don’t get the better of me.</p>
