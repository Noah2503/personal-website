<p><br/><br/>After a discussion a about a week ago I found myself wondering how much longer it must have taken to call the emergency services in the past. Sprinting to the nearest phone box etc. just doesn&rsquo;t bear thinking about.<br/><br/>Now of course everyone has a mobile phone, this has completely changed things and has certainly saved many lives along the way. My thought&rsquo;s strayed to how we could use technology once again improve our ability to help in people in need of help.<br/><br/>Also about a week ago I was ask which street&rsquo;s I used to get for A to B. I had no clue, none at all. I know less than ten street names in the whole city. What if I was required to describe my location in an emergency?<br/><br/>This task is what I propose we improve next.<br/><br/>Instead of an &lsquo;Emergency Dialler&rsquo; we have a single button on the phone&rsquo;s lock screen. You have to press it and perhaps a combination to ensure that it&rsquo;s not done in error. Warnings should display (fines for pranks etc.) and it&rsquo;s important that anyone in a state of shock could use it - avoid being needlessly complex.<br/><br/>Once 'Emergency Mode&rsquo; was activated the phone would turn on it&rsquo;s GPS, get it&rsquo;s location and send this as a text to the emergency services. On receiving the text they would then call the user.<br/><br/>There are a few other optional features, a method to send the service required as part of the text and an option to just call the services in the traditional way.<br/><br/>I think that this would really help people in a crisis and, while I can see why it&rsquo;s not here already, I think if there is talk of tweeting emergency services then this should be considered too. Personally I think the <a href="http://blog.whiteoaks.co.uk/2012/12/20/-999-emergency-services-putting-their-trust-in-social-media.aspx" target="_blank">tweet idea</a> is daft, totally unsure how that helps anyone.<br/><br/><b><br/></b><b>-charlie out-</b></p>
