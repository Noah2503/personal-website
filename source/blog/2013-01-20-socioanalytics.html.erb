<p> I’ve spent a little while on LinkedIn today, it’s a good place with a job that’s only going to become more important. One of the nice features that I only noticed today was the viewing stats. Freely available there you are told how many people viewed your page and how many people saw you in searches. For me anyway I’d find it interesting to know what the traffic was like on my other profiles.Some interesting statistics might be: (for Twitter)Per Profile: </p>
<ul>
<li>Pageviews and Pageviews from search</li>
<li>Aggregates like Totals for Retweets and Favorites</li>
</ul>Per Tweet:
<ul>
<li>Seen by Total</li>
<li>Total content/image loads</li>
<li>Total Time on Screen</li>
<li>Total cancelled replies, quotes and retweets</li>
</ul>I think it’s important that seeing as the information is public that the viewers are, at least by default, anonymous. However while doing so it would be nice to know a little about the traffic, for example by country, as is available in many other analytic tools.
<p>There are many big players on social networks that I’m sure would pay for features of this kind, that’s certainly the way that LinkedIn has decided to do it and it seems to be working out over there.</p>
<p>While it’s just a kind of ‘out of interest’ thing for me I’m sure such features would be well received and used by others.</p>
