<p><br/></p><div class="p1"><br/></div><div class="p1">DRM the three letters represent one of the most controversial topics on the internet: Digital RIght Management. For those of you who don&rsquo;t know what DRM is it is these <i>two</i> things:</div><ul class="ul1"><li class="li1">A means for content providers to ensure their content is used legally and control their content.</li><li class="li1">A system that can seriously damage the way content works for the end user - if not implemented correctly.</li></ul><div class="p1">It&rsquo;s a tough problem to solve, the users persistent &lsquo;abuse&rsquo; of EULA&rsquo;s and copyrights. DRM has fought a long battle on many fronts, music, software and so on. However, I think - at least for some content types - it&rsquo;s going to die off, here&rsquo;s three reasons why:</div><div class="p2"><br/></div><div class="p1">The one that interests me the most are <i>Online Replacement Systems. </i>These are systems that run completely online and require a log in, a paid login. The perfect example of this is Office 365. While users can share their logins, against EULA&rsquo;s, this is really easy to spot and shutdown automatically. Also, even if users were to share their logins they would get a substandard service. For example, two users can&rsquo;t use at once and you have to organise the files and folders - just a lack of personal space. This is a serious downside. While with a pirate version of Office 2012 you get almost all the features with these online systems that totally free copy is almost impossible to obtain. Hence solving the problem for now.</div><div class="p2"><br/></div><div class="p1">Another more radical solution is to build a a new product with an entirely new structure - one often similar to the above. This is more prevalent in the games industry with MMO&rsquo;s. In yesterday&rsquo;s post about Destiny, Bungie&rsquo;s new venture, I talked about how the game works - part of the new system is a constant online connection <i>requirement</i>. While the new set-up might be to ensure that the new game doesn&rsquo;t encroach on the sales of Activation&rsquo;s Flag ship: Call of Duty I would say it&rsquo;s more of a challenge to piracy. These large MMO style games with micro transactions have far lower piracy rates. While this <i>is </i>one way to get around it, and I can see how it works, it does open up lots of other problems and costs, security and hosting come to mind.</div><div class="p2"><br/></div><div class="p1">Another method, worthy of a mention is watch I can only describe as 'honesty-ware&rsquo;. It&rsquo;s quite a risky model and only seems to work for small projects with a <i>very </i>loyal fan base. <a href="http://www.charlieegan3.com/2012/12/sublime-service.html" target="_blank">Sublime Text 2</a> comes to mind. If you come up with a way to induce sufficient guilt in users for getting away with using your product past the trail period then you have succeeded here. Guilt is incredibly powerful and I can see why it works, I&rsquo;m just not sure I&rsquo;d want to risk this model myself.</div><div class="p2"><br/></div><br/><b>-charlie out-</b>
