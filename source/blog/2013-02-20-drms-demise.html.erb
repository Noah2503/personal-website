<p>DRM the three letters represent one of the most controversial topics on the internet: Digital RIght Management. For those of you who don’t know what DRM is it is these <em>two</em> things:</p>
<ul>
<li>A means for content providers to ensure their content is used legally and control their content.</li>
<li>A system that can seriously damage the way content works for the end user - if not implemented correctly.</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s a tough problem to solve, the users persistent ‘abuse’ of EULA’s and copyrights. DRM has fought a long battle on many fronts, music, software and so on. However, I think - at least for some content types - it’s going to die off, here’s three reasons why:</p>
<p>The one that interests me the most are <em>Online Replacement Systems. </em>These are systems that run completely online and require a log in, a paid login. The perfect example of this is Office 365. While users can share their logins, against EULA’s, this is really easy to spot and shutdown automatically. Also, even if users were to share their logins they would get a substandard service. For example, two users can’t use at once and you have to organise the files and folders - just a lack of personal space. This is a serious downside. While with a pirate version of Office 2012 you get almost all the features with these online systems that totally free copy is almost impossible to obtain. Hence solving the problem for now.</p>
<p>Another more radical solution is to build a a new product with an entirely new structure - one often similar to the above. This is more prevalent in the games industry with MMO’s. In yesterday’s post about Destiny, Bungie’s new venture, I talked about how the game works - part of the new system is a constant online connection <em>requirement</em>. While the new set-up might be to ensure that the new game doesn’t encroach on the sales of Activation’s Flag ship: Call of Duty I would say it’s more of a challenge to piracy. These large MMO style games with micro transactions have far lower piracy rates. While this <em>is </em>one way to get around it, and I can see how it works, it does open up lots of other problems and costs, security and hosting come to mind.</p>
<p>Another method, worthy of a mention is watch I can only describe as 'honesty-ware’. It’s quite a risky model and only seems to work for small projects with a <em>very </em>loyal fan base. <a href="http://www.charlieegan3.com/2012/12/sublime-service.html" target="_blank">Sublime Text 2</a> comes to mind. If you come up with a way to induce sufficient guilt in users for getting away with using your product past the trail period then you have succeeded here. Guilt is incredibly powerful and I can see why it works, I’m just not sure I’d want to risk this model myself.</p>
