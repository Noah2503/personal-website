<p><br/><br/></p><div class="p1">I&rsquo;ve recently being trying to crack down on the amount of email I get, I don&rsquo;t even have a job yet and I get almost 100 emails a day. Mainly notifications from services or newsletters that I&rsquo;m sure I never signed up to. I&rsquo;m currently at 11% on my Gmail so I&rsquo;ve got some time to sort it out a little.</div><div class="p2"><br/></div><div class="p1">In some ways though I need the emails, I need to know what happens and that information <i>needs</i> to be in my email inbox as I would never find out otherwise. I tend not to check my Facebook daily for example.</div><div class="p2"><br/></div><div class="p1">Some times I like to get things and sometimes have to unsubscribe from the same sort of things. I think GMail could benefit from these features:</div><div class="p1"></div><ul><li>Say you get 5 email updates from the same service/address. There should be an option to only show the latest or most important one. This means that when you followed the link you would also see the other updates. This leads to the issue of there perhaps being an update that is import and hidden in favour of a more recent less crucial one. To get round this Google could round up all the emails from the sender and produce a digested single email.</li></ul><ul><li>When you first sign up for gmail or your inbox is empty you get the option to read the news instead. This is another option I would like: Only show me news when there&rsquo;s no notifications, and only ever show me the latest from each sender.</li></ul><br/><div class="p1">This would lead to the &lsquo;hiding&rsquo; of mail, this might be problem and so these two features should be included in a separate 'Intelligent Inbox&rsquo;, much like the &rsquo;<a href="http://support.google.com/mail/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=186531" target="_blank">Priority Inbox&rsquo;</a>. I think this is where GMail should move next, more automation and intelligent features.</div><br/><br/><b>-charlie out-</b>
