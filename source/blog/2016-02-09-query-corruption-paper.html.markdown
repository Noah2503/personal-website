At the end of last term I wrote a paper titled *The effect of query length and search engine identity on computerised spelling correction of corrupted queries*. I was interested to test the correction performance of a number of search engines - the third last and final graph are likely the most interesting plots.

The paper's [here](query-corruption-paper/query_corruption_egan.pdf) if you want to take a look.
