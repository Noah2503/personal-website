_I’m back. (on tumblr)_

I started this blogging lark on tumblr late last year only to quickly change to blogger - I had some weird obsession with SEO…

Those days are gone, a lot can change in a hundred posts. Now, if you don’t find me, then, you just don’t find me - and that’s that.

All the commotion over Google Reader recently set a few off on the gloomy “What’s next?” path. Blogger seemed to be a favorite. This worried me, so this might be me jumping ship (I scare easily).

Other reasons: Better mobile app, fresh look and social integration.

I’m also going to try and make the content more varied (make us of tumblr). I’m going to stick to one main post on Saturday - here’s my proposed new schedule.

* _Monday - Instagram Photos from past week_
* _Wednesday - Link_
* _Friday - Misc (Music, Quote, Video…)_
* _Saturday - Main Post_

Lets hope that fits.
