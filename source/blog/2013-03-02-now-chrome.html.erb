<p>One of the better general tech news sites out there is Hexus.net and <a href="http://hexus.net/ce/news/internet/49129-google-now-spread-wings-fly-chrome/" target="_blank">this</a> story is what sparked this post.</p>
<p>Google Now - <em>the</em> Siri Destroyer - is expected to branch into the chrome browser sometime soon. I think this would make a lot of sense.</p>
<p>I use Google Now <em>very </em>occasionally now on my phone, normally only when I’m on my own and want to quickly get the number of somewhere, or make a call. It is very fast and does save me a little time every now and then. However I don’t like talking to my phone in public, it there’s just something odd about that - and it’s something I worry about for Glass.</p>
<p>On my computer though i’m nearly always alone, in my room. Being able to call out: “Send Alex a new email” would be handy, especially if it had a hotkey. There is however a major barrier here.</p>
<p>I like to use apps that aren’t chrome. Yes, despite Google’s desires, the best way to do lots of tasks is using an app other than chrome. This means that I would want to be able to access them with ‘Now Chrome’ too. For example: 'Create a new text file here’, or 'pause spotify’.</p>
<p>With Google pushing for an all online world I, sadly, can’t see this being included/one of it's capabilities. That said, even being able to automate the browser and Google apps would be a start.</p>
