<p>Our latest information revolution, the Internet, allows communication and the transfer of information to take place on an heretofore unseen scale. Every time you check your emails, visit a webpage, or even turn on your computer, you take part in this mass interchange of information. There are many ways to share information via the Internet, all very different: different goals, different audiences and different capabilities. We are all a part of this global phenomenon–what is our individual participation in this new world? My concern is not how you update your current Facebook status, or share holiday snaps with your relatives around the world, but how, every day, we break the law. This is such a big problem though because we aren’t the only unaware, mini pirates, there are thousands of us.</p>
<p>Let’s think back to a time before internet and computers. We love music; most have paid for music at some point. We all watch films; we’ve all been to the cinema or bought a DVD. Every day, most of us use computers to run software that we have purchased a licence for and use. This is all very well, but more and more of us are ‘stealing’ these new kinds of goods Yes, me. You too. We, usually ‘law-abiding’ citizens, are actually breaking the law, often completely unaware. Is this the worst thing going on though? Yes, it’s breaking the law, but there are explanations as to why people routinely ‘steal’ in this way. Perhaps some cannot afford the full price of the information they need, be it learning resources, images, essays, all ‘stolen’, all the time. Or people cannot access certain information due to internet censorship and government restrictions? Surely all this unauthorised copying and sharing of copyrighted material would lead to many industries folding, causing a worldwide, piracy-induced super-bankruptcy.  Interestingly it’s not, yet companies still battle and complain.</p>
<p>So what’s going on? I think that these crimes committed act as convenient distraction away from a more shocking, less well known, but much greater issue with the current desperate state of the digital media and publishing industry.</p>
<p>First, Let’s examine the different ways data can be shared, how people copy and share, and why ‘piracy’ thrives, piggybacking on the mother ship: The Internet. “Peer-to-Peer” methods are among the most popular. Programs such as Limewire and uTorrent act as portals and represent a huge proportion of illegal bandwidth, through which users can share and receive illegal files easily. Websites like YouTube, where music is shared for free, and meant only to be viewed on the site, are constantly abused. This method in particular is becoming increasingly popular. Even files from sites such as iTunes Store, PlayDigital and Amazon Mp3 are illegally distributed. With no DRM (Digital Rights Management, a method of regulating and monitoring the distribution of media publications) restrictions, the files downloaded can easily be burned to disc and shared without the use of the Internet, and in the case of iTunes, the company’s own legal software can be used to create pirate music CDs! Ever burnt a CD for a friend? Copied an image found on Google Images? Yes? Well then, there you go. It’s not only media files that are shared illegally though. In academic circles, login details of online journals are shared to give poorer researchers full access to content they should be paying a premium for. Students and even school kids are using keygens (Licence Key Generators) and cracking tools to licence heavily protected and patented software to do homework! Is it just me, or is F.A.C.T. (Federation Against Copyright Theft) fighting a losing battle here?</p>
<p>Surely it’s only right that artists of all kinds, from ‘assistant scene painters’ to pop stars, get paid for their work, just like everybody else. We should all expect some form of payment for doing our job. Music, for many, is of great importance, interest and fascination. Art and films are also very important to us, and software can be of great practical use. The creators and producers of such wonders deserve every penny we can pay and free use of the © symbol, a symbol that represents a society that cares for peoples work and creations. Copyright is in place to prevent copying, adapting, distributing, broadcasting, renting and performing in public of protected material. What would it be like if others could make a claim to the brilliance your own piece of work that you put many hours into? Copyright laws are absolutely necessary to maintain a fair society.</p>
<p>This is my problem though, it’s the a shocker. In the music industry, new artists sign up with a recording label such as EMI or Universal, and have them manage their whole musical career from start to finish. They handle everything, from advertising to awards, tours to Top 40. What is portrayed as a good deal is in reality a disaster for the artist. A catastrophic black hole that is draining, and destroying the life and passion of artists in our society. These middle men are the ones who are really dragging the artists down via exploitation of them and their fans.</p>
<p>I understand that piracy damages the music and film industries, however I think that the artists own record companies, and the methods chosen by the record companies to distribute their media, are part of a greater crime; one that is perhaps less obvious, less clear, but much more damaging. Take Apple and iTunes Store as an example to help us understand and see the extent of the blight that is infecting and destroying music and publishing industry. In the states a single track will cost about $0.99 to download and this is split, the first 35% going to big Apple and the second 65% to the greedy record company. Of this 65%, only the tiny average sum of $0.11 per song goes to the artist! Piracy costs the record producers money, but in no way does it cost 90% of their total sales! Why should artists accept these poor deals? Yet this absurd system seems to be the only way for the world’s musicians. Yes some artists do try to make their own way in the vast, musical ocean but they don’t last long. Should artists only option be to walk the planks of the record labels ships?</p>
<p>The greedy record labels acting over and above morals, just keep on wanting even more. Though they get enough money from legal sales to end world poverty and find a cure for every disease in the book, sadly they still scramble for every last penny. Every day in the name of their artists, (plank walking peons of profit production), they wage war against individuals and organisations that break copyright laws. These lawsuits are petty acts of injustice against the world in the name of music are outrageous. </p>
<p>There will forever be wind in the sails of the ever evolving pirate ships for as long as people are treated unfairly.</p>
