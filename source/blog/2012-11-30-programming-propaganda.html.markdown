Today I filled out a survey giving feedback on my first term courses, one of those being ‘Programming and Principles’. Programming and Principles was described by the lecturer as: “A course designed to help you think like a programmer.”

I feel qualified to call myself a programmer, not an experienced programmer, just: a plain programmer. I write programs and I see that as the only prerequisite. In being a programmer I believe, that to some extent at least, I think like one.

I would describe my course of Programming and Principles quite differently. I would say it helps programmers program maths into their projects and that only. It offers an insight into how we represent novel mathematical ideas and concepts in an algorithmic format. This is actually very interesting but has a tendency to get rather detached from the ever changing real world of programming. And it is in this world where the programming jobs exist in their entirety. One thing that I fail to see is how anyone could think that programming (as an activity) could be derived to math alone. True, mathematical understanding goes a long way in many scenarios however in many others it couldn’t be less useful.

I propose a more useful course. My course would without a doubt include some of the math fundamentals like set theory and matrix representation but I would also include a new theme. This new area would cover a different type of problem and one we encounter more frequently - syntactic errors. Now you think: but these are all specific per language, per interpreter - this course is meant to be independent of this. I agree and it still can be.

I’m not suggesting that we churn through all the Visual Studio errors, learn them, and common causes, by the book - not at all. Instead we learn good programming practices, methods to find our errors and how go about fixing them when we do. How to structure code and how to describe a persistent problem to others. Lets face it we’ve all ended up at stackoverlow and we don’t like being laughed at when we get there.

I think this alteration would help the course better achieve what it aims to do and make it a more valuable experience. 

Not many people like a survey, quite frankly neither do I, but if you have an improvement to suggest its a crime not to bother.
