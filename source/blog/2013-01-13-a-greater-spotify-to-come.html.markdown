[Recently](http://www.spotify.com/uk/help/faq/purchases/download-store-changes/) Spotify took their music download service offline. This worried me a little, I use Spotify as a kind of _grande store of full previews._ I then buy 100 tracks for 50p each a few times a year from a playlist I build up.
I now believe the plan is _not_ in fact to remove the service but instead change it. Spotify has poor record for [equality](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_qzEYq1W0kGc/S8fOdhQ4m3I/AAAAAAAABIE/yseFnPAov94/s1600/selling_out_550.png) and I really hope this isn’t a move to make a little extra on those bargain downloads.

I’m all in favor of system improvements but with their music downloads I saw nothing to improve. The system seemed solid and sufficiently different to attract new users. I also think if I noticed that Spotify will have too, and they might be interested in making some earning alterations before it gets more mainstream.

Still, lets think positive for now, lets hope that it’s even cheaper or there are some nice extra options like you get a few free ones per month and have to pay per each extra at the same rates as before - much like a mobile tariff.

Spotify is a great service - and while it can be a little more buggy than iTunes it does seem to just work, lets hope it remains that way.
