Programs that help lighten the load:

## Acronis TrueImage Plus Pack
A common request at the shop is: “I want a new
computer _exactly_ like my old computer - only faster”. This would not be
economically possible if it weren’t for Acronis TrueImage with plus pack. This
has one crucial feature: disk restore _with a driver scan. _This means you can
keep all the same data, _programs, licensees and settings._ While still pulling
in new drivers to run them in the new environment - smart data migration if you
like. ‘Universal Restore’, as it’s called, has made many a happy customer.

## Produkey
I don’t trust licences - they’re an almighty pain. Produkey solves
that - it pulls them out of the debris and saves a simple text file. Need to
re-activate office? No problem. There are no other tools that do this so
quickly and effectively.

## WhoCrashed
Don’t have the time to read ntbtlog.txt? No problem, this one
does that for you. The only pain is that it needs a to run in a Windows
environment - so you’ll likely need to take the disk out.

## Wise Portable Registry Cleaner
It’s portable. It doesn’t leave remnants and
popups on users computers. That’s good enough. Not to mention that it’s a
pretty thorough registry cleaner too. It’s fun to tell people you single
helpfully fixed _1500 _registry errors!

## Autoruns
An **essential**! An absolute must. This is the first stop in the
tune up routine. Get rid of auto starting bloatware - fast! It’s easy to clean
out everything from scheduled tasks to hidden startup processes. You’ll find
you can easily create Blue Screens if you’re not careful so don’t go overboard.
Also, some actually like the 'Ask Toolbar Updater’ - watch out for that too.

## driveridentifier.com
A catalogue of links to the source - it’s free to
download directly from the manufactures. Solves the serious problem of
maze-like OEM support sites. Note - _it’s not pretty_, but also, and more
importantly, not a scam.

## Ninite
Install the essentials in on fell swoop. Update java, flash - the lot
all in a oner. It’s a really handy one for setting up new PC’s. I only wish it
had even more options - it’d be nice to have ESET in the AV list of options.

## GetDataBack
It’s not cheap but can help generate very happy customers! It
scans for lost data and does an incredible job of recovering dead fragments.
The only downside is the cost - it’s about £140…

So there you have it - a list of incredible tools for setting up and fixing
computer problems to add to the old favourites.
