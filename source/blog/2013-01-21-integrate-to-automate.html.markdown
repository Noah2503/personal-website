Similar to the topic of my last post, this ones another suggested social network improvement: Automation. I know the two could have come together in a joint post but I’d not really thought of this until today. I think that there is potential for more capable APIs to allow a much greater variety of use in out social networks.

To some extent they already talk to one and other, for example foursquare tweets my new mayorships. But I think we need a lot more control on network cross posting. 

There is a service called [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/) that is aimed at exactly this. I use it to post all my blog posts to my LinkedIn for example. However the service is crippled, in my opinion, by some really restrictive APIs. Google+ doesn’t even have a one!

I think that while there is potential for more spam traffic with these suggestions that all the companies involved deal with greater and more complex problems everyday. I think that there should be much more (optional) talk between these services.

The more content the better, even if it did come from another network first.
