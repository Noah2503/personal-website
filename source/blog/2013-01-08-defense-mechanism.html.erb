<p><br/>I was called the other day and asked for to verify the email address on my Paypal account. Instantly alarm bells start going off and I jump to the conclusion that this is a scam - I end the call rather rudely. At the time though there was something going on with my account, a negative balance in fact and the phone call had got me worried.<br/><br/>I called up Paypal just to check, it was in fact a valid call. This however wasn&rsquo;t clear at all! It seemed totally ingenue! There must be a better way they can do this.<br/><br/>They claimed they had sent me an email today - they hadn&rsquo;t, all the more suspicious. But I think the way to do it would be to send out an email that instructed you to login to your account, after doing this it would display a button like &lsquo;call me now&rsquo;, much like amazon use in fact. You would then know that that it was a genuine call.<br/><br/>The reason they can&rsquo;t do that though is because they need to get in touch with me, I could just ignore the button.<br/><br/>The banks give you so many fraud warnings it&rsquo;s making people really untrusting. This might a good thing for security but it&rsquo;s created a huge problem for genuine customer support. Authentication is always going to be a major challenge.<br/><br/><b>-charlie out-</b></p>
