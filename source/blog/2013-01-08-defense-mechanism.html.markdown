I was called the other day and asked for to verify the email address on my Paypal account. Instantly alarm bells start going off and I jump to the conclusion that this is a scam - I end the call rather rudely. At the time though there was something going on with my account, a negative balance in fact and the phone call had got me worried.

I called up Paypal just to check, it was in fact a valid call. This however wasn’t clear at all! It seemed totally ingenue! There must be a better way they can do this.

They claimed they had sent me an email today - they hadn’t, all the more suspicious. But I think the way to do it would be to send out an email that instructed you to login to your account, after doing this it would display a button like ‘call me now’, much like amazon use in fact. You would then know that that it was a genuine call.

The reason they can’t do that though is because they need to get in touch with me, I could just ignore the button.

The banks give you so many fraud warnings it’s making people really untrusting. This might a good thing for security but it’s created a huge problem for genuine customer support. Authentication is always going to be a major challenge.
