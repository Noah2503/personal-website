<p><br/>I&rsquo;ve been keeping this blog, my twitter, my journal and my foursquare as a log of what I think about, where I&rsquo;ve been and what I plan to do next. I&rsquo;m enjoying keeping them up but have yet to get to the point where looking back induces any kind of nostalgia. Until yesterday I&rsquo;d all but forgotten about my oldest set of records -<i> my music library</i>.<br/><br/>It&rsquo;s a very different kind of record but it&rsquo;s a record all the same. I&rsquo;ve been keeping it going since about 2006, as opposed to 2012, and because of this it's more interesting to look back on.<br/><br/>When looking back and listening to some of my older tracks you realise how much you associate music with a particular time period. I have some playlists called Memory 1,2,3.. - these are collections of music that I associate with a certain time and memories. However I don&rsquo;t really know exactly when that time is as often I get the songs after &lsquo;their time&rsquo;.<br/><br/>'Date Added&rsquo; helps a lot and as I&rsquo;ve moved on with the library I&rsquo;ve taken care to keep these correct. Hopefully in years to come making the memory playlists will come easier.<br/><br/>One word of advice. I get all my music from Spotfiy and plan to continue doing so. Playlists there can be sorted by date added this is fine until you download them. You don&rsquo;t want to click the tempting 'Get Playlist&rsquo; button but instead download the tracks separately and wait for them to finish. This way you maintain the order (while sadly losing the original added date). For me at least that&rsquo;s quite important.<br/><br/>As long as Apple is careful with iTunes my musical menology should be good for another few years.<br/></p><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">(50 posts)</span></div><div style="text-align: left;"><b>-charlie out- </b></div>
