This is again a suggested feature for mobile phones. It’s not likely to save the same number of lives as yesterdays but it would be a nice feature all the same.

The background: phones get notifications. Lots of them, messages, interactions, emails and so on. Lots of these, namely emails and interactions you get while on your computer too. 

The problem: you are ‘over-notified’ of updates whilst at your computer.

The fix: implement a mode called: 'Proximity Ignore’.

This feature would be user controllable but also have the option of 'sensing’ you were at your computer. This might be done by:

  * -Setting a Wifi network that was where you use your computer
  * -Noticing that you weren’t moving with GPS
  * -Noticing that the phone wasn’t been used to check the time.
  * -Setting 'Computer Use’ hours in settings
  * -'Spotting’ your laptop on Bluetooth
  * …

This would mean an end to the annoying 'over-notification’ problem and the endless flashing LED’s that follow.
