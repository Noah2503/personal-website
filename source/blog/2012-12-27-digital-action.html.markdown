I quite enjoy [films](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nMuwdxvExGoSVOg3Lu6ndFI061BNyeNj-F4ZoOaFJ3g/edit) - I like to sit, turn it all off for a few hours and get into a story. I also like to be either fooled or fascinated by the film - by that I mean: I like films to seem possible in real life or to come over clearly as a fictitious story. Anything in between is a no go.

There are too many films that use computer to achieve the impossible, they are used to exploit the general ignorance of them in order to make sense of nonsensical narrative. This is very frustrating. You’re working your way through a film and it’s going fine, you’re getting into it and enjoying the plot as it unfolds. Bam! All of a sudden the secret password is stored in a _‘secret partition of RAM’ _or a computer is _hacked _while it is not even online.

These blatant digital goofs are becoming less common as people, rightfully, get sick and tired of this utter rubbish. That said, there are still films coming out today with this rubbish - just very frustrating.

I went to see the Hobbit just before Christmas and it was a relief not to have to deal with any of this, it was just a good old fashioned tale.

It’s fine when you know it’s not real, when you know it’s all just a story, a tale or prediction. The problem occurs when these gross technical inaccuracies leak into what could otherwise be true(ish) stories.

I wonder what other gaping holes there are in films with respect to weaponry or procedures, areas outside our expertise. If I found out perhaps I’d **only** enjoy fantasy movies - ignorance is bliss it seems.
