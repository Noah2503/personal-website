<p><br/>A problem that I&rsquo;ve had since upgrading to 10.8 Mountain Lion has been with the Open With menu. I find that over time there is a build up of duplicates. Primary offenders seem to be: Pixelmator and Evernote.<br/><br/>It seems to solve the problem this is the command:<br/></p><blockquote class="tr_bq"><code>/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreServices.framework/Versions/A/Frameworks/LaunchServices.framework/Versions/A/Support/lsregister -kill -r -domain local -domain user;killall Finder;echo "Open With has been rebuilt, Finder will relaunch"</code></blockquote><div>Then Relaunching the Finder with <code>⎇ cmd esc</code> should solve the problem.<br/><br/>However I found that the issue kept coming back. I just decided to remove all the apps and assign apps manually. You can do the same by following this guide <a href="http://osxdaily.com/2011/02/03/clear-open-with-menu-mac/" target="_blank">here</a>.</div><br/><b>-charlie out-</b>
