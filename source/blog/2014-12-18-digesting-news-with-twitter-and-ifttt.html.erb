<p>I’ve been trying to cut down on the time I spend reading news for a long time, I even built my own Ruby news aggregator and summariser. Lots of NLP and lots of mess.</p>
<p>I’ve recently settled on a simpler solution using <a href="http://www.ifttt.com" target="_blank">IFTTT.com</a>. Most sources tweet new content, this is gives a <strong>ready summarised</strong> feed in a <strong>consistent form</strong> for <strong>all sources</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://ifttt.com/recipes/230600-tech-news-digest" target="_blank">Here is the ‘Recipe’ I’m using</a></p>
<p>Clearly you’ll want to follow different accounts, or maybe less of them. This lists around 200 items a day. It normally takes between 5 and 10 mins to scan the list.</p>
<p>I don’t read them in the morning, only add them to 'Reading List’ from the iOS mail client to pick them up later on. (normally while walking or eating!)</p>
<p>I still use <em>Yahoo! New Digest</em> for world &amp; UK news.</p>
