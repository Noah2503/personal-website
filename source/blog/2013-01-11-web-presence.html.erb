<p><br/>This time last year charlieegan3 didn&rsquo;t really exist on the internet, I had accounts that showed up in Google but nothing important really.<br/><br/>I spent a great deal of <a href="http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=1371929" target="_blank">time</a> on the matter and eventually reached the conclusion that, against the suggestion of some, I should probably get it.<br/><br/>The main reason was that it might look like I&rsquo;d had an account and removed it because it was so bad. Seeing as the social network search has become such a big part of recruitment I thought I might as well sign up at least.<br/><br/>It might have been different if I was looking to get into any other field, but with computers you&rsquo;re expect to have all this stuff first, not last.<br/><br/>In the end though Facebook has only been used for communicating with course mates and I&rsquo;ve adopted other services for the other jobs.<br/><br/><b>-charlie out-</b></p>
