<p><br/><a href="http://www.sci-news.com/othersciences/sociology/article00863.html" target="_blank">Link to Article</a> at <i>Sci-News</i><br/><br/><i>Future Orientation Index </i>- the interest we take in the future is good for GDP.<br/><br/>This was quite an interesting article that came up a few days ago in my twitter feed. The collective data from the worlds internet searches is a <a href="http://www.google.com/trends/" target="_blank">fascinating</a> resource. I take an interest in technology and it&rsquo;s future but the idea that a <i>whole interested country</i> is more successful was new to me.<br/><br/>I think it&rsquo;s an important message. The message that to succeed we need to come up with new ideas and better ways to do things - one to think about anyway.<br/><br/><b>-charlie out-</b></p>
