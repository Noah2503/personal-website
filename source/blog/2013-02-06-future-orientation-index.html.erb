<em>Future Orientation Index </em>- the interest we take in the future is good for GDP.
<p>This was quite an interesting article that came up a few days ago in my twitter feed. The collective data from the worlds internet searches is a <a href="http://www.google.com/trends/" target="_blank">fascinating</a> resource. I take an interest in technology and it’s future but the idea that a <em>whole interested country</em> is more successful was new to me.</p>
<p>I think it’s an important message. The message that to succeed we need to come up with new ideas and better ways to do things - one to think about anyway.</p>
