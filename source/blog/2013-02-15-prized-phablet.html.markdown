Yes, another phablet post, it’s something I see as having the potential to make big changes in the industry (and perhaps [fashion](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887324442304578236480316234780.html?mod=WSJ_hp_EditorsPicks&utm_source=buffer&buffer_share=5e4bd)!). I’ve got the Galaxy Note 2, the first majorly successful device in the category - it’s been the perfect device for me and it's largely to thank for the success of the category as a whole.This Samsung branded [success](http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/technology/2013/01/samsung_how_the_korean_firm_got_to_be_the_biggest_tech_company_in_the_world.html) is starting to really generate competition, others are starting to take notice, and [recent](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/02/10/iphablet-ipad-mini-retina-apple-rumors_n_2647684.html) [rumours](http://www.macrumors.com/2013/02/13/apples-4-8-inch-iphone-6-reportedly-not-launching-until-mid-2014/) would have us believe that includes big Apple.An Apple phablet is a thrilling prospect. This is what I predict it will need to succeed while fitting in with Apple’s current range of mobile devices:

* _5" Retina Display_ - this is a must, to achieve a similar volume of screen content as the note 2 but in a smaller form factor.</li>
* Stylus not required - however a means to achieve some ‘higher level’ editing features like annotations would be important. Samsung should be implementing Air View with a finger soon so that’s a possibility.
* Revised iOS - without this it simply wont work. iOS needs to take on more forms and phablets need one of them.
  * True Multitasking
  * Side-by-Side App Windows
  * Editing and Annotation Features

There are also a few features such as a better share feature that I personally feel should be in all versions of iOS - but that’s a different list.

If Apple do venture into the phablet market it needs to be early 2014 at the latest. If it’s not sorted before then Samsung’s phablet experience might be too much to topple with a new take on the walled garden. 

Apple - I wish you luck.
