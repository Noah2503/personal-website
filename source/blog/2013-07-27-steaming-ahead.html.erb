<p>I’ve got a real issue with app stores. I think they’re great, incredible even. I totally agree with what they’re trying to achieve, only, <strong>not</strong> in the <em>rather lazy</em> way in which content hosts are going about implementation. App Stores are, in too many places, little more than the bare minimum.</p>
<p>There’s one reason for this, and it’s set to stay this way. There’s no competition. If you want an iOS app you must use the Apple App Store, and getting an app from anywhere but the Play store is all but unheard of. There’s no pressure to make the experience better, no motivation to innovate. And certainly on iOS, Apple try their hardest to <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-13579_3-57579631-37/appgratis-tries-petition-to-shame-apple-on-app-removal/" target="_blank">stamp out</a> any other attempts. These better thought-out App Markets are an embarrassment to them. Sadly the response is removal, rather than change.</p>
<p>SO we’re left with a cold-bare-bones content delivery system. Anyway, this post is about one that does somewhat stand out, an ‘App Store’ from before <em>the </em>App Store: Steam.</p>
<p>Steam’s somewhat wiser than the newcomers, and it’s experience really shows. It <em>is</em> up against competition though, retail. Thanks to that it’s really needed to be quite special to get noticed and adopted.</p>
<p>Firstly it’s a much nicer place to shop. There are filters, not like though of Amazon or Ebay but search options that put Play and the Apple store’s to shame. There’s vast amounts of content on all of these stores - there needs to be a realistic way for people to browse. Steam’s the only one at the moment that seems to be even attempting that! Sorting and filtering of any kind any where else is little more than a joke - endless lists, shoddy categories, poor sort criteria…</p>
<p>I’m not going to come out and say that the aim of a good app store is “Impulse Buy Incitement” but steam’s system of sales and reductions really do work! In the last week I’ve twice been notified of a game on sale and that that lead to a purchase on my part. Google doesn’t offer wish list notifications, Apple doesn’t even have a wish list…</p>
<p>Ideally I’d like to see <strong>Monopoly App Stores ruled as anti-competitive behaviour</strong> to insight a bit more interest and innovation in the area - letting digital distribution live up to it’s promise.</p>
