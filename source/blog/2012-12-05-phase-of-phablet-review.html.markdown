Before I came to university I never really used a mobile phone much - everyone I needed to contact used email, and so did I, it just worked back then. That all changed though. I don’t know what is is about student life but a mobile phone is essential, an absolute must. ‘Paying As You Go’ became very expensive and I needed to change my system.

The plan had been to hang around for the iPad mini, I had always liked the idea of tablets - just not in their full size. Now though, with my need to make calls, two and two were put together: Smartphone. I almost instantly decided that this was the best option and, not being a big iOS, fan started looking into the Android market. I’d seen an interesting phone on rumour sites: The Galaxy Note II. After waiting for the release, much reading of reviews and a trip to the local 3 Store a purchase of phone and contract was made.

It’s big. But that has yet to be a problem - so far it’s size has only made it better.

The best traits of the phone itself would have to be the following:

* The screen size makes it comfortable to use for long periods of time - whether that be twitter, reading the news or doodling on the train it always feels natural.
* The S-Pen is quite a nice add on and it really does increase the range of activities possible on the device. Most days I tend not to use it, but in those odd moments with complicated tasks it’s only way to get something done. It’s also quite fun for more detailed sketching.
* The phone is exceptionally powerful - It scored really high on[Geekbench](http://browser.primatelabs.com/geekbench2/1295419) and you basically don’t have to wait a any operation - the way it should be I guess.

It’s also made stronger with its Android bond, my favourite software features must be:

* The slide down for notifications and common settings must be the most useful - just works perfectly and saves so much time when you’re constantly switching between WiFi and mobile data, silent and normal…
* The way apps and widgets are handled is also great. The seven, totally customise home screens took some time to get perfected but now they’re setup they’re really useful. I have (from left to right) News; todos; popular contacts; common apps + twitter, SMS, Email, Data usage + more apps.
* Finally, tethering is a handy feature to use on the train, and is all handled by: Android OS.

Some of the greatest fun though is in the apps, but I’ll save them for another day.

It’s become an all round and perfect solution to information and communication on the go. I’m really glad that this problem pushed me into getting it because, having experienced it now I couldn’t have lived with iOS - and my objection to iOS is definitely a story for another day!
