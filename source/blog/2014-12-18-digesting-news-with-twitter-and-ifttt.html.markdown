I’ve been trying to cut down on the time I spend reading news for a long time, I even built my own Ruby news aggregator and summariser. Lots of NLP and lots of mess.

I’ve recently settled on a simpler solution using [IFTTT.com](http://www.ifttt.com). Most sources tweet new content, this is gives a **ready summarised** feed in a **consistent form** for **all sources**.

[Here is the ‘Recipe’ I’m using](https://ifttt.com/recipes/230600-tech-news-digest)

Clearly you’ll want to follow different accounts, or maybe less of them. This lists around 200 items a day. It normally takes between 5 and 10 mins to scan the list.

I don’t read them in the morning, only add them to 'Reading List’ from the iOS mail client to pick them up later on. (normally while walking or eating!)

I still use _Yahoo! New Digest_ for world &amp; UK news.
