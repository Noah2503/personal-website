_Future Orientation Index _- the interest we take in the future is good for GDP.
This was quite an interesting article that came up a few days ago in my twitter feed. The collective data from the worlds internet searches is a [fascinating](http://www.google.com/trends/) resource. I take an interest in technology and it’s future but the idea that a _whole interested country_ is more successful was new to me.

I think it’s an important message. The message that to succeed we need to come up with new ideas and better ways to do things - one to think about anyway.
