<p><br/><br/></p><div class="p1">I&rsquo;m sat here on my phone, they&rsquo;re all watching football but I&rsquo;ve been busy on my phone - mainly on Google Plus.</div><div class="p1"><br/></div><div class="p1">Google Plus for Android is an <i>incredible effort</i> and I&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s the closest thing to what an all purpose social network should be. There is a feature for everything important and a neat layout for every feature.</div><div class="p1"><br/></div><div class="p1">I&rsquo;ve often thought that Google Plus has the potential to<i> be all social networks</i>, it can be Twitter or Facebook or somewhere in between. It&rsquo;s the functionality of Facebook with the simplicity of Twitter - and that&rsquo;s quite a selling point.</div><div class="p1"><br/></div><div class="p1">My favourite features must be: hangouts (as calls to my phone), notifications that go away when checked on the desktop (facebook fails here) and how sharing works from apps from other Android apps.</div><div class="p1"><br/></div><div class="p1">I really wish it was all I had to use but there are some problems:</div><div class="p1"></div><ul><li>Firstly: circles, they&rsquo;re a good idea, just poorly implemented. Organising your connections is really handy, however, the separate feeds seriously hinder the feature. There needs to be a better way to sort and view the separate feeds. Because you can share with <i>any combination of connections</i> the feeds can rather awkward, with some posts only showing in all. There should be a tab for each circle and a tab for more &lsquo;exclusive&rsquo; shares.</li><li>The only other problem is content. It&rsquo;s all just too well mixed up. Posts from friends, communities etc all get mixed up. Each post is also allocated a significant amount of screen space. This leaves rather a small amount of content on screen which can almost 'detach&rsquo; you from the idea that it is in fact a feed at all. They could invest in a more compact twitter like summary feature here to help keep posts of similar size.</li></ul><br/><div class="p1">Google Plus, with the rise of Android, has the potential to really take the crown. Working on the web version UI and a couple of other minor improvements would my first step to getting there.</div><br/><b><br/></b><b>-charlie out-</b>
