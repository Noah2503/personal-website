This little adjustment has probably saved me hours over the past few months and
is a must for any programmer.

1. Open_ System Preferences._
2. Open the _Keyboard_ preference pane.
3. Choose the _Keyboard Shortcuts_ tab at the top
4. Then find and select _Services_ on the left.
5. Then find and check the _New Terminal at Folder_ item.

Now the services menu when right-clicking on a folder contains _New Terminal at Folder._

I’ve also found the terminal built into [Sublime Text 2](/blog/2012/12/18/sublime-service)
quite handy recently.
