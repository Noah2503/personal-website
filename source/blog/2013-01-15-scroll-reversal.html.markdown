This may not seem the most fascinating of topics but I’m still interested in interfaces and how mobile devices are influencing other areas. So, scrolling - it’s a pretty key part of standard interaction. We’ve become very fond of our little scroll wheels and all that - one might expect it to remain constant.

Think about a smartphone or touchscreen device, how do you scroll on that? If you want to scroll down you must push the page up - it's inverted. Yet we all just see this as natural, the norm, and get on with it.

Apple decided though that this was going to be _the _way to scroll and made it the default across their mac product line with 10.7. I say all part of making the Mac more adoptable to new users from iOS.

It’s quite an interesting one for me though, which way is really the most intuitive? I think that, while it’s not likely to be the same for everyone, I prefer the inverted way and believe that this is the more natural way.

However this does create some problems, switching to a PC and back can sometimes be a little awkward.

Apple has had quite a few feeble feature failures, but in terms of trackpads and input they still win hands down over any other manufacturer.
