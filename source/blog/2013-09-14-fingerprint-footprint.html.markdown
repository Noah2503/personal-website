Biometric authentication has arrived.

On Tuesday Apple announced the iPhone 5S. The first mainstream handset to sport integrated biometric authentication via fingerprint scanner. At last.

How long I’ve been looking forward to a password killer… Passwords have been one of those recurring issues, like the yet unfixed SLA… I hate them.

It’s only a start however, there’s, as of yet, no third party support via an API or otherwise. This hasn’t been hinted at but has been discussed and will come in due-course. I just hope Apple have the sense to stay out in front, they’ve certainly got the resources.

I’m glad it was Apple to get there first. The last two years of iOS have been feeble to say the least. As an Apple fan I have to say seeing BA, iOS7 and the A7 put everything back on course has been a relief.

When the API is all sorted and has some real uses I’ll seriously consider trading in my Note II. And to put things in perspective, that’s a device I love and have no regrets with. iOS7 and the fingerprint sensor might just be too enticing!

Why the drastic change and perhaps unfounded optimism? As I may have mentioned before, I have an app idea that needs this to function, hence my excitement.

To the success of biometric authentication and the demise of “did you forget your password?”!
