<p>In June of next year I will hopefully be able to get <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/adsense" target="_blank">AdSense</a> on my site. To get access you need 6 months of time adding content. I imagine it will pay out next to nothing - In fact I’m certain of it. There isn’t likely to be enough traffic even by then, still I’m keen to give it a go. Hopefully things will still be happening here in June.</p>
<p>Anyway this topic brings me on to a more interesting one. I currently use <a href="http://adblockplus.org/en/" target="_blank">Adblock Plus</a> and thanks to that I just don’t see ads. This is great if you’re on a slow connection like I am - it means less waiting time. That said, I think that it is our job as web users to at least look at the adds to keep the free services we use up and running.</p>
<p>Many of these services, like my <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/" target="_blank">favorite forum site</a>, are funded almost completely by AdSense revenue.  If we want to keep using these <em>free</em> services then we are going to have to keep loading the ads.</p>
<p>I’m not really sure how I think ads should be handled on the internet - it’s a difficult one. I think the more intelligent the ads are the better - I’m never going to click on instant fat or wrinkle removal. I think all ads need to be a little more tailored and relevant to the user.</p>
<p>I will pay to remove ads, I’ll get a ‘premium account’ where I feel it's appropriate. Just donating to Adblock doesn’t feel quite right!</p>
