For those of you who don’t know what Finder is, see [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finder_(software)).

Finder has some problems - but I’d never want to even upgrade it or even replace it.

I got a license for and app called ’[TotalFinder](http://totalfinder.binaryage.com/)’, it was part of a larger bundle in which I also got [MacRabbit’s](http://macrabbit.com/espresso/)

[Espresso](http://www.charlieegan3.com/2012/12/where-but-to-web.html), one the best apps I own. I installed it and used it passively for quite some time. It was only taking a moment to think yesterday that I realized I never used the tabs feature and I knew that it has a dropbox folder bug that was bothering me. I got rid of it and I’m much happier to be back to the default finder.
There’s no need for tabbed browsing in that way for the mac files system. Certainly not for me. If you were working with a file system all day you might want some extra features like those offered in [Path Finder](http://cocoatech.com/pathfinder/) by Cocoatech. I can see some of it’s features being quite handy for sysadmins.

However, I’d say for the rest of us, venturing beyond the default Finder might be a waste of time and money.
