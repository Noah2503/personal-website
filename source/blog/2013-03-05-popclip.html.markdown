I’m not a big iOS fan but I’d heard good things about an app that further blurs the line between the iOS and OSX: [PopClip](http://pilotmoon.com/popclip/). When I say it featured on [lifehacker](http://lifehacker.com/5985248/top-10-underhyped-mac-apps) I finally decided to get it.You think it’s certainly not as useful as you might be led to believe but then you realize the [extensions](http://pilotmoon.com/popclip/extensions/) and that all changes.There are absolute loads out there - more than enough to choose from. These are my favorites:

* Case Changers. A feature OSX apps lack when compared to MS Office is a simple case changer. PopClip and it’s ‘Text Transformation’ extensions change that.
* Sort. This takes in a number of lines, removes any duplicates, and returns the unique values in lexicographical order.

So it’s not me going over to the iOS way - just getting some extra features that’s all. It’s certainly a lot better than the comparable feature in iOS.
