<p>This is again a suggested feature for mobile phones. It’s not likely to save the same number of lives as yesterdays but it would be a nice feature all the same.</p>
<p>The background: phones get notifications. Lots of them, messages, interactions, emails and so on. Lots of these, namely emails and interactions you get while on your computer too. </p>
<p>The problem: you are ‘over-notified’ of updates whilst at your computer.</p>
<p>The fix: implement a mode called: 'Proximity Ignore’.</p>
<p>This feature would be user controllable but also have the option of 'sensing’ you were at your computer. This might be done by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>-Setting a Wifi network that was where you use your computer</li>
  <li>-Noticing that you weren’t moving with GPS</li>
  <li>-Noticing that the phone wasn’t been used to check the time.</li>
  <li>-Setting 'Computer Use’ hours in settings</li>
  <li>-'Spotting’ your laptop on Bluetooth</li>
  <li>…</li>
</ul>

<p>This would mean an end to the annoying 'over-notification’ problem and the endless flashing LED’s that follow.</p>
