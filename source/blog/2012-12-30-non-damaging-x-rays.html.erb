<p><b><br/></b>I went on my first flight in a long time a few days ago. It&rsquo;s also the first time my new laptop has done any serious traveling. I really hate flying, I know that statistically it&rsquo;s very safe and all but I just can&rsquo;t get over the thought that if it goes wrong we&rsquo;re all dead.<br/><br/>Prior to arriving at the airport though this was not the main worry - the main worry was (as usual) my laptop. Having never flown with a laptop before I had got into my mind that x-rays would destroy it, or that the staff would steal it!<br/><br/>I put it all in a tray and handed to the guard - it just went straight on into the scanner! I was super worried by this point. Then after the new experience of full body metal scanners and pat-downs my precious was returned to me!<br/><br/>It had not been stolen and not been destroyed but was in fact quite alright! Phew. I really don&rsquo;t like flying at all and will aim to use the bus in future. I quite like traveling and would like to make use of the time spent doing so. Planes are just too short and scary to get on with anything meaningful.<br/><b><br/></b><b>-charlie out-</b></p>
