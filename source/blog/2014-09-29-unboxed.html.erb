<p>This summer, July through September, I completed a summer internship at <a href="http://www.unboxedconsulting.com" target="_blank">Unboxed Consulting</a> - a Rails Consultancy in London. I had a really incredible time and was lucky enough to be invited back. I really can&rsquo;t wait for next year.</p>
<p>Here are some of my key learning milestones from this summer.</p>
<p><strong>CSS Selector Weights</strong><br/>Okay, I really ought to have known this before arriving in London. When I first started out I was mainly working in the front end and this was a pretty crucial first lesson! Before mid July of this year I didn&rsquo;t know exactly how #id &gt; .class &gt; tag fitted together. Looking back I didn&rsquo;t really know at all, and now I do.</p>
<p><strong>Git Branching &amp; Re-basing</strong><br/>I knew how to create a branch &amp; how to merge them - I also understood that new code should happen in a new branch, but that was pretty much about as far as my git knowledge extended. I quickly learned about how different levels of branches related to one and other and how these were used when deploying code. I checked out my first feature branch, opened my first Pull Request and completed my first code review. I&rsquo;d like to see this knowledge and strategy being particularly useful this year on the group work software engineering project.</p>
<p>Re-basing code was also a new one for me, I&rsquo;d always just assumed that messy merge commits were a necessary evil in the history - it seems this is not the case! Being able to work on a longer running feature branch and regularly stacking those changes on a new copy of master or develop became a really great tool.</p>
<p><strong>Slower Coding ∴ Massively Better Code</strong><br/>This is really pretty darn obvious but I still think it&rsquo;s worth mentioning. I&rsquo;d worked semi-professionally on Rails applications before starting my internship but only at <em>Unboxed</em> did I learn to think about my code in an entirely different way. Before, when cramming for a student deadline I&rsquo;d never bothered with code quality/readability, it&rsquo;s just not really a big thing in student code. I&rsquo;d never really had code reviewed in greater depth than: &lsquo;It works&rsquo; before. And that changes everything.</p>
<p>Being given the time to improve and really think about my code was a really great learning experience. After a few months of this I&rsquo;ve been a lot less trigger happy and have spent a great deal more time looking into best practices and refactoring my code before calling it done.</p>
<p><strong>TDD</strong><br/>Before using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development" target="_blank">Test Driven Development</a> in a pairing context I&rsquo;d never really understood even the basic motivation behind TDD. It took a long time, but towards the end of my time at Unboxed while pairing on a client project I finally understood what it’s all about. I gave it a test run on a personal gem project of mine and it really does work, using <a href="https://github.com/vcr/vcr" target="_blank"><u>vcr</u></a> and <a href="https://github.com/guard/guard" target="_blank">guard</a> felt like a breakthrough for me as a programmer.</p>
<p><strong>Decorator Pattern</strong></p>
<p>This is another thing that&rsquo;s come up a lot this summer. Following on with the theme of thinking more about my code this is something I&rsquo;ve come to use in my apps. The idea of separating view logic into a separate presenter class to make a lot of sense - before I&rsquo;d just never really thought about it. The <a href="https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/screencasts" target="_blank">Destroy all Software</a> screencasts have been really great at teaching me how best to set this up in fresh projects.</p>
<hr><p>This summarises the key lessons I took away from this summer, there are many others that are smaller or hard to put in words. It was a really great experience, the team at Unboxed were a real joy to work with - I was made to feel extremely welcome. I just can&rsquo;t to get back into that world.</p>
