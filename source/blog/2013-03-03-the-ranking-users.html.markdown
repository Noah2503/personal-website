One of the problems with online systems, one that I find particularly interesting, is the ranking of users. How a user progresses their membership, and how you use that data.

Not all sites openly display a users rank, most still rank users in the background, but I’m interested in the systems that make ranks visible. Common examples would be forums, Foursquare check-ins + badges and I suppose tweets and followers to an extent. These are all numbers that show the level of engagement with the site and this information can be very useful.

Displaying such information to users allows them to formulate behaviors towards each other.

Certainly in forums this is very important - I know it is at macrumors.com. Your rank and the time you’re been a member is often what an argument boils down to. It also effects the way in which people respond to you and your posts - it’s quite interesting really.

Foursquare check-ins are more for fun, you don’t respect someone with more you just get on with it. Still there are leader boards to help stimulate a little competition. Twitter is an odd one here, there aren’t any clear rankings but people certainly note the number of followers or tweets a user has. In many ways the ratio of these figures helps you formulate your initial opinion of that user.

In conclusion I think these little ‘Social Scores’ help keep users interested and competing - getting them right can really make a service great.
