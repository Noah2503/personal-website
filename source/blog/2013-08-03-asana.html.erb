<p class="p1"><span>My boss regularly asks me for ideas on how to help streamline things in the business. Here&rsquo;s my review of a product we&rsquo;ve put into action this week: Asana.</span></p>
<p class="p1">We&rsquo;ve already got a very versatile CRM system that&rsquo;s a little slow but does the job just fine. What we were lacking was communication in the office, a shared task list if you like. No member of staff is there all the time, and things were getting lost in the chopping and changing about. We&rsquo;re hoping Asana can help with this.</p>
<p class="p1">So far it&rsquo;s only really me that&rsquo;s been using it, getting to know it better so I can teach the other members of staff in due course.</p>
<p class="p1">I&rsquo;ve been keeping track of everything I do on there to act as an internal, searchable record for everyone. I hope that one day we can all do that - and ultimately have a better understanding of what we need to each be working on.</p>
<p class="p1">Anyway, lets cut to the chase. Asana, day 5:</p>
<p class="p1">It&rsquo;s a really swish app and there&rsquo;s too many benefits to list here. The fact that we are keeping the software on into next week says enough. I think it&rsquo;s set to stay at least for now.Â </p>
<p class="p1">My favourite feature is the &ldquo;searchability&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s just so fast, incredibly fast to find everything that&rsquo;s come and gone. It&rsquo;s so much more flexible and searches in a much more modern and intelligent way - when compared to our CMR vtiger system.</p>
<p class="p1">It&rsquo;s also got a great kind of checking off feeling. Once a projects done then it&rsquo;s archived, still searchable, yet out of sight and mind for the time being. I think it&rsquo;s what we all need, a little motivation and clarity in in the work we do.</p>
<p class="p1">There are a few things that would be great to have included. Here&rsquo;s my constructive criticism:</p>
<p class="p1">&ldquo;All Projects View&rdquo; - there doesn&rsquo;t seem to be a way to view a list of all the projects to sort them. That seems a little crucial to me. It would be great if there was an overview table that I could use to browse all the projects and see the most recent activity and who can see and contribute to them.</p>
<p class="p1">&ldquo;Project Sorting and Categorisation&rdquo; - the other feature that Asana sorely needs. It wold be great to be able to organise the projects into some kind of folder structure. There&rsquo;s nothing like that at the moment, only workspaces but they&rsquo;re totally private it seems. If everyone does in fact start using asana we&rsquo;re quickly going to have too many on going projects on going and that&rsquo;s a major issue. I think we might need to have teams or people subsets of some sort to sort that one out.</p>
<p class="p1">It&rsquo;s a great service none the less and should make a big difference to the business if encouraged in it&rsquo;s early stages.</p>
