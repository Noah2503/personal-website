I’ve not done a review in what feels like a long time, so here’s three combined into one. Three of the bigger games in the Tower Defence scene.

**Radiant**** Defence**

[Radiant Defence](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.hexage.defense&hl=en) by [Hexage](http://www.hexage.net/) is the first game of the genre I started playing on my phone. It’s a really pretty game, the visuals are undoubtably the best of out of the three. The animations very smooth, and backed up on a solid yet sensible color scheme make it a winning combo.

The gameplay’s clearly been well thought out too. Players have clear control over the enemies path but is kept nicely in check by a “Module” ration. This allows route choice to be a key part without allowing overpowered endless ‘zigzagings’.

There’s a good range of turrets, and while some of the 'essential’ ones are in-app-purchases, they’re cheap as chips and are well worth the fee, especially when given the rest of the game is free. For the record I’ve come to basically support this method of monetization in mobile apps and games - but maybe more on that in another post.

The menus and UI are fast and as clean as the rest of the games visuals. I like their reasonably minimalist style, they’re also pretty quick which is always nice.

There are some things that bother me about the game - and after a few good train journeys I’ve basically stopped playing it.

Firstly there are two types of structure, I’m going to call them perishable and non-perishable. If you fail a wave non-perishables are refunded while perishables are not. This means that on the second attempt you have a reduced spending allowance. This makes it harder and harder to the point where you have to restart the mission as a whole. There needs to be a clearer structure refund setup - and one that doesn’t make the _same wave_ get any more challenging on repeated failure.

The real reason I stopped playing though was because third last mission ramps up in difficulty too quickly. There’s not enough cash or modules to complete it without superhuman insight. Yeah, I admit it, it's basically too hard!

**Plants vs. Zombies**

[Plants vs. Zombies](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.popcap.pvz_row&feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDEsImNvbS5wb3BjYXAucHZ6X3JvdyJd) by [PopCap](http://www.popcap.com/) (now EA Swiss) is a little more imaginative than the tower defence baseline. Rather than trying to fix a genre that’s fundamentally broken (but one I still enjoy) it’s aimed to redefine it - and to an extent it has.

It’s simpler, waves come in various channels from left to right, you need to cover each to succeed against a very diverse range of enemies. Diversity in fact is where the game really excels, the range of 'towers’ and enemies is outstanding and really set’s it apart from the others.

It also builds up in difficulty well, although perhaps a little slowly. There’s a steady stream of unlocks and changes to keep you interested and a shop to choose our upgrade route. If I was to go back to a Tower Defence game today it would most likely be this one - though that’s not to say if’s my favourite.

However there are some issues that let it down. The graphics are nice in game but the menus feel somewhat dated. Animations have a style of, perhaps, being a little amateur and but it’s one that I’m not a fan of.

The game’s also very slow to load on Android in comparison to the others and saps battery at a far greater rate.

**Jelly Defence**

[Jelly Defence](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=pl.idreams.jellydefense&feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDEsInBsLmlkcmVhbXMuamVsbHlkZWZlbnNlIl0.) by [Infinite Dreams](http://www.idreams.pl/en/) is my most recent acquisition in the genre. It’s a good looking game and would count in my books as a 2.5D game. This requires significantly more power to run so I let it off a little extra power usage and heat.

I’d like to say I’d played the game a great deal but I haven’t, only a few hours in fact. It’s basically another that’s a little on the difficult side. It, too quickly, becomes excessively hard. There’s very little you can do about that either.

If the lack in tower types wasn’t enough the lack of any route control makes things very boring and frustrating very quickly. There’s two types of enemy, red and blue. There’s only one tower that does both types but it’s not very good. This means you have to build up two parallel sets of towers. It’s very expensive and it’s very hard to get the balance right.

It’s also expensive to buy outright. So thanks to the lack of any means of a tryout I’ve bought a game I don’t like.

***

You may have got the impression that I don’t really like any of them - and you wouldn’t have got completely the wrong end of the stick. I don’t think it’s the games though, I think the genre itself is flawed.

Enemies are going to need to get tougher, towers are going to need to get better, it’s either too easy or too hard. What I’m getting at is that there’s too few factors to create chance and change in the gameplay and ultimately creates games that are hard to keep playing.
