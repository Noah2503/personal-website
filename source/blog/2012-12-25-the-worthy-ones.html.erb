<p><br/>I use Mac and Android - I think it&rsquo;s the perfect combination of things for me. In the same way that an and aspiring author finds interest in books I find interest in programs and serivces. Software can be a work of art, a genuine invention with the power to do good and help us out.<br/><br/>I could go on in there and list all the standard ones that are, quite frankly, great, but I&rsquo;m going to focus on the &lsquo;rarer&rsquo; ones.<br/><br/>I&rsquo;ve been back in the Mac Software scene since July, I&rsquo;ve spent way too long trying and buying interesting apps - these are the favorites:<br/><br/></p><ul><li><a href="http://krillapps.com/coderunner/" target="_blank">CodeRunner</a> has already had a mention <a href="http://www.charlieegan3.com/2012/12/simple-as-syntax.html" target="_blank">here</a> but it deserves a lot more than two mentions. It is a must by for any computer science student and has already saved me a huge amount of time on my course. It&rsquo;s got a great UI and works perfectly for everything I&rsquo;ve needed from it so far. I look forward to seeing where this one goes in 2013 - It has the potential to go very far.</li><li><a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/2" target="_blank">Sublime Text</a> (nit just) Another dev tool. This one has also been a big help especially in my recent Rails assignment. It is also very well designed and will be my text editor of choice for the foreseeable future.</li><li><a href="http://macrabbit.com/espresso/" target="_blank">Espresso</a>, a more recent addition to the list and perhaps even more deserving than the rest. Espresso is helping me move in a new direction with my computing studies and I&rsquo;m looking forward to where that is going to be. It is just the perfect package for what I wan&rsquo;t right now. It even inspired me to try coffee again, however that was less successful - I really can&rsquo;t do coffee.</li><li><a href="http://dayoneapp.com/" target="_blank">Day One</a> is not a dev tool - It is a beautifully simple private journal. I&rsquo;ve been using it since september to record my thought and plans - it&rsquo;s great, so far I&rsquo;ve been able to keep up with my goal of one entry per day.</li><li><a href="http://www.sparrowmailapp.com/" target="_blank">Sparrow</a> this humble mail client - keeping my mail browser independent since July! Basically is the simplicity of gmail built into OSX. It truly is a great tool and should be your first download on any new mac. It&rsquo;s been a real help and has been one of the best fivers I&rsquo;ve ever spent. With Sparrow it&rsquo;s not about what it does but instead how it does it - perfection.</li></ul><div>I&rsquo;ve had my Android <a href="http://www.charlieegan3.com/2012/12/phase-of-phablet-review.html" target="_blank">Note II</a> since I realized that my student life requires a smart phone in late October. I&rsquo;ve not spent nearly as much here but there have still been some good finds.</div><div><ul><li><a href="http://www.endomondo.com/login" target="_blank">Endomondo</a> has been a real help in achieving my 5k goals this year. While I don&rsquo;t run with it every time it has allowed me to get some interesting 5k routes for me to train on. I&rsquo;ve tried the competitors out but the features are second to none. It&rsquo;s after run map and stats are a little addictive but are useful too. A great app all round.</li><li><a href="http://keymonk.com/" target="_blank">Keymonk</a> is another <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0CDQQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.charlieegan3.com%2F2012%2F12%2Fkeymonk-keyboard.html&amp;ei=teLUUO-0I-ao0AWpxYHgBA&amp;usg=AFQjCNGQdx9S0-M-PDOJAHM5bg3gxoQ5JA&amp;sig2=kjzaHP5d-nolbJOWh6HIRA" target="_blank">repeat</a>, it&rsquo;s just too great not to mention again. Take a look at my 'review&rsquo; for more details as to why this keyboard deserves a little more recognition.</li><li><a href="https://maps.google.co.uk/" target="_blank">Google Maps</a> is has been really useful in perfecting my routes through the freezing city of Aberdeen. It's beautifully implemented on Android and is more than deserving of a mention.</li></ul><div>I&rsquo;ve not included apps that are associated with services or games, they&rsquo;ll be up tomorrow.</div></div><div><br/></div><div>Have a Merry Christmas.</div><br/><b>-charlie out-</b>
