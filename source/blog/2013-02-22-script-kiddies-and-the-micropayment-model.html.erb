<p><br/>I about a week ago I read a an <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-21371609" target="_blank">article</a> on by BBC on Script Kiddies cheating Microtransation systems in games. I found the story somewhat annoying for a number of reasons.<br/><br/>The first was the way that &lsquo;offenders&rsquo; were discussed. The tone was so superior.<br/></p><blockquote class="tr_bq">Most were written using basic coding languages such as Visual Basic and C#, and were written in a way that contain quite literal schoolboy errors that professional hackers were unlikely to make - many exposing the original source of the code.</blockquote>First off, C# and Visual Basic can be used to make <i>exceptionally complex</i> systems. I fail to see how the readability syntax has any meaning here - bear in mind these languages may have been the only/most accessible way to implement such a tool. That doesn&rsquo;t make them 'basic&rsquo; - MSDN would lap up that tone&hellip;<br/><br/>The <i>11 year old kids </i>made mistakes professional programmers with CS degrees and years of experience were unlikely to make. Isn&rsquo;t this a surprise!? 11 year old kids make mistakes in spoken English too and we don&rsquo;t turn our noses up at that.<br/><blockquote class="tr_bq">You teach your children that you can&rsquo;t take a toy without paying - so I think this type of a message needs to get to the kids when they&rsquo;re writing software too.</blockquote>Okay, digital products can be replicated an infinite number of times - they have no manufacturing costs.  While it is perhaps wrong that they can get stuff for free it also brings into question: should developers be able to sell content in this way? This is up for debate and is currently a subject I'm undecided on.<br/><br/>I think what is damaging about the article through is it gives kids interested in programming a bad name, a reason to be watched and worried over. While it&rsquo;s not as good as making a website or an app, you&rsquo;ve got to start somewhere, and the skills learned will eventually benefit the industry.<br/><br/><b>-charlie out-</b>
