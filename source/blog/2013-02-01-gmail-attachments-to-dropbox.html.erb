<p><br/>Answer: <a href="https://attachments.me/" target="_blank">attachments.me</a>. Story:<br/></p><div class="p1"><br/>With my phone I get access to a <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/help/297/en" target="_blank">50GB Dropbox</a> - it&rsquo;s a nice perk but one I will almost certainly never fully use. I guess many others will be the same but I&rsquo;ve set out to start filling mine up.</div><div class="p2"><br/></div><div class="p1">50GB is a lot and I thought that the best way would be to fill it automatically, as I create/receive content, rather than uploading things manually. This set me off on the long trail of things, one being to automatically forward all my attachments to Dropbox - this seemed no easy task.</div><div class="p2"><br/></div><div class="p1">I&rsquo;d been interested in <a href="https://ifttt.com/" target="_blank">IFTTT</a> and had been using that to do lots of <i>similar</i> things, that was my first stop. It seemed so close to being possible. There were a few crucial problems with the various recipes that I tried. The first problem is that Google don&rsquo;t provide an attachment URL in the Gmail API. This created a second idea: forwarding to the IFTTT trigger address. But Gmail doesn&rsquo;t allow you to forward to an unverified address and I had no way of verifying it. Next I tried forwarding the &lsquo;attachmented&rsquo; mail to another of my personal addresses and then getting them to forward on to IFTTT (not all webmail needs verification for forwarding). This didn&rsquo;t seem to work either as the mail seemed to retain it&rsquo;s original address and wasn&rsquo;t firing the trigger.</div><div class="p2"><br/></div><div class="p1">All in all this was a lot of work with <i>no </i>results - it didn&rsquo;t even work a little bit.</div><div class="p2"><br/></div><div class="p1">Before IFTTT I had briefly looked at the other options, there were quite a few but none seemed to be what I wanted. I did however make the mistake in brushing over <a href="https://attachments.me/" target="_blank">attachments.me</a>.</div><div class="p2"><br/></div><div class="p1">When I first looked at this it only seemed to enable you to <i>selectively</i> forward attachments to Dropbox, how wrong I was. If I&rsquo;d taken the time to look a little closer I would have found that it can, in fact, automatically forward all attachments too.</div><div class="p2"><br/></div><div class="p1">I&rsquo;d spent hours trying to build my own way to do this with IFTTT, assuming that there must be a way - it seems there isn&rsquo;t. The thing that is interesting though is that <i>attachments.me</i><b> </b>must be using the GMail API too, just as IFTTT does - I would pay to know how on earth they got that working!</div><br/><b>-charlie out-</b>
