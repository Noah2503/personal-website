_Wearable Tech _is getting a lot of attention at the moment - I guess I might as well join in.

I think the selling point for me is the handsfree and minimalist scent to the idea - as well as it acting as an extension of our current phones and tablets. I get criticised for this by people I know, I like to solve problems with more tech purchases - this is one of those problems. 

I have one of the largest smart phones you can get, the [Galaxy Note 2](http://bit.ly/15q7Khx). It’s a fantastic phone when you’re using it but a little bit of a pain when you’re pocketing and unpocketing it. The idea of being able to switch tracks, check the time and pause my run with a smart watch is very attractive. Being able to evaluate the importance of a notification blip would be great. However I think there is more to come from wearable tech, more to come in the form of Google Glasses.

As far as I know Google Glasses work as a standalone device, that said I don’t see why it can’t act as, or have a cheaper version that acts as a smartphone extension. Using the conniptions, setting and data from the parent phone or tablet the Glasses could be extremely useful. Applications such as camera trigger come to mind. Instead of a loud ‘Take a photo of this’ you could simply press a virtual shutter on your phone. It would work both ways, sometimes the Glasses assisting the phone, other the phone as siting the Glasses, as in the example above.

I think the set with Google Glasses, smartwatch and smartphone would be the ultimate combination. All communicating and assisting each other, and in turn the user!
