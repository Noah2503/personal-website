<p><span>I recently finished reading <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Masters-Doom-created-transformed-culture/dp/0749924896/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1422132733&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=masters+of+doom" target="_blank">Masters of Doom</a> by David Kushner and thought I&rsquo;d write a short response. It&rsquo;s the first book I&rsquo;ve read from start to finish since I was a child.</span></p>
<p>The book was lent to me by a <a href="https://twitter.com/IllegalCactus" target="_blank">friend</a> but it was my interest in shooters and a powercut that got me to <em>actually sit down</em> and read it. I haven&rsquo;t invested the time that some have in multiplayer FPS titles but I&rsquo;ve definitely had a go. I think networked shooters are the most technically interesting video games - the genre certainly faces the greatest challenges. Responsive networking and graphics are heavily punished by even the tiniest blips.</p>
<p>So a book that covers their inception and &lsquo;founding fathers&rsquo; had be interested and ultimately got me hooked. I&rsquo;ve never played Doom or even Quake for that matter and you really don&rsquo;t need to get the book. The id story is a great one - with some even better characters - and while depressing at times, as a whole, it&rsquo;s very inspirational.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;d recommend it to anyone who&rsquo;s ever been at all invested in an FPS - as well as to any student programmer who&rsquo;s into video games. There&rsquo;s a lot to learn from the book - it&rsquo;ll really make you think.</p>
