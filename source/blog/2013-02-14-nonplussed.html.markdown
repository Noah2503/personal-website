I’m sat here on my phone, they’re all watching football but I’ve been busy on my phone - mainly on Google Plus.

Google Plus for Android is an _incredible effort_ and I’d say it’s the closest thing to what an all purpose social network should be. There is a feature for everything important and a neat layout for every feature.

I’ve often thought that Google Plus has the potential to_ be all social networks_, it can be Twitter or Facebook or somewhere in between. It’s the functionality of Facebook with the simplicity of Twitter - and that’s quite a selling point.

My favourite features must be: hangouts (as calls to my phone), notifications that go away when checked on the desktop (facebook fails here) and how sharing works from apps from other Android apps.

I really wish it was all I had to use but there are some problems:

  * Firstly: circles, they’re a good idea, just poorly implemented. Organising your connections is really handy, however, the separate feeds seriously hinder the feature. There needs to be a better way to sort and view the separate feeds. Because you can share with _any combination of connections_ the feeds can rather awkward, with some posts only showing in all. There should be a tab for each circle and a tab for more ‘exclusive’ shares.
  * The only other problem is content. It’s all just too well mixed up. Posts from friends, communities etc all get mixed up. Each post is also allocated a significant amount of screen space. This leaves rather a small amount of content on screen which can almost 'detach’ you from the idea that it is in fact a feed at all. They could invest in a more compact twitter like summary feature here to help keep posts of similar size.

Google Plus, with the rise of Android, has the potential to really take the crown. Working on the web version UI and a couple of other minor improvements would my first step to getting there.
