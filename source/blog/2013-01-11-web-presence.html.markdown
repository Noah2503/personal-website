This time last year charlieegan3 didn’t really exist on the internet, I had accounts that showed up in Google but nothing important really.

I spent a great deal of [time](http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=1371929) on the matter and eventually reached the conclusion that, against the suggestion of some, I should probably get it.

The main reason was that it might look like I’d had an account and removed it because it was so bad. Seeing as the social network search has become such a big part of recruitment I thought I might as well sign up at least.

It might have been different if I was looking to get into any other field, but with computers you’re expect to have all this stuff first, not last.

In the end though Facebook has only been used for communicating with course mates and I’ve adopted other services for the other jobs.
