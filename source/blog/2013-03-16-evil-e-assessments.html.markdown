Online assessments are have become a big part of life since my move to
university last year. They’re typically in the form of a web based
questionnaire that are accessible via the university student portal.

The idea, in theory, is sound, however there numerous issues that really
let them down. Here’s what, I think, needs to change.

* _Scoring Clarity_ - One of the most obvious issues with these tests is that
  the candidate often has no way of determining the available marks and
  penalties. For example: How much is this question worth in relation to the
  total/last question? What is the penalty for getting this one wrong? It needs
  to be a very clear statement about this either at the beginning, or next to
  each question if they’re different per question.
* _Undo / selecting none_ - Often multiple choice questions are done with radio
  buttons, and once you’ve chosen one you’re stuck with making an answer. This
  is all well and good until you introduce negative marking - then it becomes
  the biggest flaw in the book, as it almost forces you to answer. This is
  again simple to fix, just add a none answer and give it 0 points, rather than
  a negative score.
* _How many answers?_ - This time it’s not the buttons but rather the question
  wording, if you can select more than one answer then you need to know how
  many to choose! But you would think that everyone would spot that…nope…
* _Cut out cheating_ - This basically devalues the entire system. I think these
  tests should be done in class time to ensure that they are valued correctly.
  Until then no one is going to take them seriously.
* _Select the essay_ - you can’t do that. Not all questions can be boiled down
  to choosing the best answer. Some responses need written answers and these
  really do need marking. Until we build a 'marker AI' this is going to remain
  a big problem. It basically severely limits the scope of use for any testing
  system.
* _Dropped connections_ - Lots of testing systems seem to need a continuous
  server connection, often to enforce a timer. This is fine, and I can see why
  it’s done, however everyone knows that the network isn’t flawless and that
  these things lead to problems. I’m not sure how you solve this one but it’s
  really not fair to loose out because of a blip in the connection.

Fixing online testing is far from an easy task but there seems to be some low
hanging fruit.
