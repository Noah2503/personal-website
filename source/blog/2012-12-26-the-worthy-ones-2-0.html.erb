<p><br/>Yesterday, as part of what I&rsquo;m sure was your favorite Christmas present, I covered my top apps for Mac and Android. Two areas though were left out: Services and Games, here goes!<br/><br/>I make use of a very wide range of services some paid and some free, these are the ones that have impressed me the most. I&rsquo;m going to leave out the basics like Evernote, Dropbox, Spotify, we all know they&rsquo;re great and so I&rsquo;ll not bore you with them.<br/><br/></p><ul><li><a href="http://getpocket.com/" target="_blank">Pocket</a>. While Pocket could have come into yesterdays app round-up it&rsquo;s going to come in here since I now use it on my phone too. I basically use it as a global bookmarking service and it&rsquo;s perfect for just that. I like to read articles but not always right then and there - this allows me to pick them up at a later date, often on the train. My favorite thing though is that it cuts down the articles to only the article text, this makes it really nice and simple to read with no distractions - a great service all round.</li><li><a href="http://www.google.co.uk/analytics/" target="_blank">Google Analytics</a> claims the second mention - it&rsquo;s become the first thing I check, even before my mail sometimes. The number of options and snippets available about sites is incredible - all for no cost what so ever.</li><li><a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-GB/Live" target="_blank">Xbox Live</a> - the all hated, all frustrating, global past-time system never fails to amaze me. It&rsquo;s just amazing what an incredibly advanced system this is, it&rsquo;s just a shame games are so frustrating! Hats to to <a href="http://majornelson.com/" target="_blank">Major Nelson</a> and everyone at the Xbox team, you&rsquo;re keeping Microsoft alive.</li></ul><div>That brings me on nicely to the next category: games. I wanted to keep them separate as I count them, personally, as kind of a different thing.</div><div><ul><li><a href="http://www.frozensynapse.com/" target="_blank">Frozen Synapse</a> gets first mention as it&rsquo;s fun:fustration ratio is the best of any game I&rsquo;ve ever played. It&rsquo;s varied, it&rsquo;s fun, it just works. I never thought I could enjoy turn based strategy to this extent having previous stuck to real time. Just an amazing game with a great dev and community. I also have to like it because it&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.mode7games.com/content/about.html" target="_blank">British</a>!</li><li><a href="http://cubementd.com/" target="_blank">Cubemen</a> is another <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/" target="_blank">Steam</a> bargain success. While not as fun and a little more frustrating this game was still great fun. It&rsquo;s got a surprisingly interesting setup that leads to some great varied gameplay. While there were a few bugs out there but the developer was great to talk to and had everything sorted right away. Another great up and coming classic.</li><li><a href="http://www.halowaypoint.com/en-us/" target="_blank">Halo 4</a> - It has to be included, it came late in the year and it was tarnished my a horrific university internet connection, however, it&rsquo;s a great game all the same. It&rsquo;s 343&rsquo;s take and I&rsquo;m going to have to get used to it. It&rsquo;s certainly a new direction and while it&rsquo;s almost definitely not as good as previous games it think there is potential and a future for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/343_Industries#Games" target="_blank">343</a> with Halo - I&rsquo;m especially interested to see where they go in terms of other genres. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bungie" target="_blank">Bungie</a>, my favorite developers new title also <a href="http://www.bungie.net/News/content.aspx?type=topnews&amp;cid=32235" target="_blank">leaked</a> this year, it looks like it&rsquo;s well sorted out too. Thanks to the spilt I&rsquo;m left with the best possible outcome, more great games from a great series and a great developer.</li></ul><div>So that&rsquo;s it for the round-ups, the new year is fast approaching and hopefully some more fantastic feats of software design are headed your way too.</div></div><div><br/></div><br/><b>-charlie out-</b>
