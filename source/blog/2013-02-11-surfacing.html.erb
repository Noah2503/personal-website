<p>I was browsing <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/Surface/en-GB/surface-with-windows-8-pro/specifications" target="_blank">here</a>, taking a little interest in the upcoming Surface Pro from Microsoft when I read this.</p>
<blockquote>64GB*, 128GB</blockquote>

<p>Yeah it’s not the most interesting sentence in the world but it left me puzzled. Are Microsoft being honest here or are they pushing you to upgrade? I know that they need this little disclaimer to cover themselves but it seems a little obvious - right there in plain sight rather than tucked away at the bottom in a tiny font. Because of this I reckon it’s a push for you to upgrade to the more expensive option - which is really quite expensive...</p>
<p>Anyway enough of the sales pitch analysis and on the the topic of Surface in General.</p>
<p>I’ve started seeing Surface RTs around, there are about 3 people on my course with them (more than opening use iPads in lectures). I was sitting behind one yesterday. It looked quite good - while the text was very small it looked pretty responsive and useful. Much more like a useful netbook than a tablet - but in a tablet form. The keyboard also seemed to be able to produce text pretty quick too - I’d like to have a go with it actually. The guy was using a rubber stylus to draw diagrams and then typing on the keyboard - it did look like a bit of a <em>digital note-taking boss!</em></p>
<p>That said I’m happy with my system, more than happy in fact. Still, the next time I’m in the centre of town I’ll try and look one out in a shop somewhere - give that keyboard a try. *click</p>
