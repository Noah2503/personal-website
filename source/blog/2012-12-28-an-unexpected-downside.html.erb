<p><br/>If you&rsquo;ve read through any amount of my content on either here or <a href="https://twitter.com/charlieegan3" target="_blank">twitter</a> you may have picked up that earlier this year I bought myself a new Apple Macbook. It&rsquo;s a fantastic machine, the best computer I&rsquo;ve ever owned - an all out five star product. However there are disadvantages that lie out with the computer it&rsquo;s self.<br/><br/>They are almost all associated with worry - It&rsquo;s always on my mind. If I leave it I worry about locking the door, if take it out I worry about breakages.<br/><br/>I have taken out student laptop insurance which, while very expensive, I deem to be worth it. It covers me for everything I worry about, this means that I shouldn&rsquo;t worry - annoyingly I still do.<br/><br/>I think there is a lesson to be learned here. While I doubt I&rsquo;ll ever get to the point where £2000 loss is negligible, there hopefully there will come a time when it is less worrying. It&rsquo;s just that when it&rsquo;s more money than you&rsquo;ve ever spent and more than you plan on spending for the foreseeable future it&rsquo;s bound to give a little worry. I think that in future I will go for a cheaper laptop and desktop combo.<br/><br/>That said, it has been a fantastic laptop and has been an outstanding tool and aid and while I remain anti-iOS, I also remain one of the biggest mac fans around.<br/><br/><b>-charlie out-</b></p>
