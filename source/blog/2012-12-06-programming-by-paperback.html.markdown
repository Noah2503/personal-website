‘An Introduction to…’, ‘Beginners Guide for…’, ‘Introducing…’ the list goes on. There is a boundless collection of [books](http://www.amazon.co.uk/s/ref=sr_nr_p_n_feature_browse-b_mrr_0?rh=n%3A266239%2Cn%3A%211025612%2Cn%3A71%2Cn%3A269678%2Cp_n_binding_browse-bin%3A492564011%2Cp_n_feature_browse-bin%3A400530011&bbn=269678&ie=UTF8&qid=1354566413&rnid=400529011) that teach programming. My question is: Are we still so much more familiar with books that they remain the best way to learn?

In terms of volume, there seems to be a much greater number of beginners books - true, there are the ‘Complete References to…’ and ‘Bibles of…’ but the fashion seems to be the entry level titles. Is this as simple as a greater market or do books genuinely set you off to a better start? This certainly fits with personal experience, I find a book on a language can quickly teach you the ground rules - guiding you step by step. Once I’m rolling though I tend to turn to online resources for further, more problem specific solutions.

Another possibility: is the mere fact that books are detached from the screen is enough? Is being able to read a book while quickly checking back to the screen sufficient to make us prefer them? I would say that while I do find this useful it’s not a major thing, then again an extended desktop does go a long way. Of course you can also take a book around with you, go lie out side and read it over but I find that I just want to head straight back to the computer to test code out.

Getting value for money out of a purchase can motivate us too. While it’s perhaps not the best kind of motivation it works all the same and gets us programming. It’s easy to buy that book and say: “This will help get be started” and I think, often subconsciously, we do work to make that happen. Often purely to justify the cost.

Some say books are better quality - I say there are different kinds of quality. A book is proof read and well structured into a neat package. Online resources are different in that they’re often user fed, and can lack structure. On this one I take a side, I would say that online option offers a greater quality of learning experience and with zero cost. Take a website like [stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/), it’s comprehensive knowledge and diverse user base make it my first stop. Systems like this put books to shame when it comes to sheer depth and interactivity, I can see them - combined with clear, entry level tutorials -becoming the standard way to learn code.

I’ve clearly had to use both physical and online materials and it does seem to result in a certain solidity. The trend seems to be: get the book; get through approx. ¼ ; then either: give up or continue online. That said I think I’ll replace books in future with beginner tutorials just to save that wastage of experimentation.
