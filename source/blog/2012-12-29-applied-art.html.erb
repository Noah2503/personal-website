<p>I grew up without a T.V. and in doing so missed out on quite a bit in the way of adverts too.  Because of this I think I have a rather more accepting view of adverts than others to the point where I quite enjoy them.</p>
<p>I’ve been to the cinema twice recently and both times have thought about this. It’s all part of the atmosphere  part of the experience. You don’t have to like them, don’t have to buy the products afterward, just sit and enjoy the scenery.</p>
<p>They are art, there is no denying that. However they have much more of a purpose - Applied Art.</p>
<p>There is often a great deal of thought that goes into these shorts, and they are much more than a plain sales pitch.</p>
<p>Art and wonderment aside they also seem to help you get settled in the ‘film watcher mindset’. It’s all just part of being a good capitalist!</p>
