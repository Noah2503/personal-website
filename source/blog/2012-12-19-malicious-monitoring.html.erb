<p>When you visited this site the link that brought you here tracked your exit and I tracked your entrance. Google gives website owners the <a href="https://www.google.com/analytics/" target="_blank">tools</a> to monitor the traffic related to their sites.I can tell when the site was visited; if it was visited by you before, and how many pages you loaded. I can tell what browser you used; what your operating system is; who hosts your internet connection and where they say you are. This allows me to test my site for various different usage types to make sure it works for everyone - it's essential for a frustration free web.</p>

<p>I see why this is good, why it's necessary and how it’s all just part of the service Google provides. But because it doesn’t tell you that you are being logged after every page load the older generation is surprisingly put off by this.</p>

<p>Of course Google can use this information for show you <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/adsense" target="_blank">ads</a>. We all understand that this is all part of the internet but to some older folk this personalized advertising seems scary, a little big brother like. People just need to learn that this is the way that the internet works - they can easily block ads if they want to. Google isn’t out there to sell your soul they’re just funding their free service. There are ways to stop it if you really hate it that much though, take a look into: <a href="https://www.torproject.org/" target="_blank">Tor</a>, and <a href="http://adblockplus.org/en/" target="_blank">AdBlock</a>. This ties well with a popular quote from a MetaFilter discussion in <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/95152/Userdriven-discontent#3256046" target="_blank">2010</a>.</p>
<p><blockquote>If you are not paying for it, you’re not the customer; you’re the product being sold.</blockquote>All I have to say is, that while that is profoundly true, it’s a small price to pay and is easily avoided. It’s the future and I think it’s just a small part of what is ultimatly a good thing.</p>
