I pass a great deal of time on the forums at Macrumours.com. On the 7th I came across [this](http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?p=16621621) - yet another kid iOS developer. These articles seem to generate a particularly strong conflict of emotions, I’ll try and explain but I’m not promising anything.

First is just of wonderment. How could someone so young be so mature? So sorted out? I did cycle the End to End when I was 14, and while it’s still an achievement I know which looks nicer on a résumé…

Every time they’ve clearly been wealthy Americans - this bothers me - it’s _jealousy_. While I’m by no means disadvantaged, I never had access to a 27" iMac and a Retina Macbook Pro - many thousands of pounds - at the age of 14. I had to work for two years to buy my rMBP and there was certainly no spending cash left over for an iMac at the end of that - aged 18. The only difference between this and a child musician with an expensive instrument is the employability. The kid programmer is going to walk into a job, the musician, no matter how good will face tough competition and rejection.

Okay, so you think it’s unfair to say it’s all about the money. It is, clearly the boy is a bright kid and deserves to do well. However, would he be where he is today without some serious parental capital? Or, perhaps more importantly, could anyone else match his achievements on a budget?

Prior to the shock of that experience the _motivation_ kicks in, it’s why I know these stories do me good. After watching the video I feel that I must do better, get ahead even. I console myself the thoughts that there are very few people like this - there is still hope!

Getting ahead has yet to come - one day though, one day.
