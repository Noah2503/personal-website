<p>Sharing ones snapshots online has, &lsquo;got big&rsquo; to say the least. Instagram&rsquo;s become my service of choice. It gets<span> a hard time - and I can see why. There&rsquo;s a ton of junk on there - in fact it vastly outweighs all any quality</span><span> content. There is however </span><em>enough </em><span>good content to keep me there.</span></p>
<p><strong>Flickr</strong></p>
<p>Flickr, the original, has a proven track record. It's phenomenally thorough in what it does and it does it well. It&rsquo;s probably the best, but not for my needs. If I used a DSLR and didn&rsquo;t own a smartphone then this is where I&rsquo;d be. However this is not the case, and this is my mobile photo sharing review.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s let down by it&rsquo;s speed of photo submission. There are too many steps that take too long. There isn&rsquo;t the snappy feeling as there is with the Instagram upload sequence. Metadata entry is expansive but a fiddle, there&rsquo;s something to be said for minimalism in apps.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also got a slightly odd community. There are bots that comment and like photos, and some slightly awkward users. It&rsquo;s also, apparently, not as active. There isn&rsquo;t anything like the engagement per photo that there is on Instagram.</p>
<p><strong>500px</strong></p>
<p>First major problem is: You cannot upload from mobile devices. I don&rsquo;t know about you but that seems to me to be somewhat, essential!? There&rsquo;s also a pressure to take out higher level memberships which neither Flickr or Instagram pester you for (although Flickr did).</p>
<p>The content is very high quality though and it&rsquo;s clearly trying to set a reputation for itself. A valid goal for sure. I think that there can be some very good photos taken on phones and they&rsquo;re missing out there. It&rsquo;s not like they filter out rubbish content when it comes from your computer.</p>
<p>The app itself is fairly swish, but the absence of the most important feature makes, to me, it totally pointless.</p>
<p><span>I publish all my Instagram photos to 500px and Flickr via IFTTT, just for fun.</span></p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Instagram, being mobile first will remain my service of choice for the time being. The speed of submission and browsing make it the clear winner for me. Minus a little spam and plus some slightly more agile editing tools it would be perfect. It&rsquo;s got the community, now it just needs to keep the app fresh.</p>
<p><em>Note on Video Sharing: </em><span>Instagram recently got the option to record video clips - much like Twitter&rsquo;s Vine. Interestingly, being a little later to the party&rsquo;s certainly made it&rsquo;s performance on Android much nicer. Vine for Android really does have some catching up to do.</span></p>
