<p><br/>This may not seem the most fascinating of topics but I&rsquo;m still interested in interfaces and how mobile devices are influencing other areas. So, scrolling - it&rsquo;s a pretty key part of standard interaction. We&rsquo;ve become very fond of our little scroll wheels and all that - one might expect it to remain constant.<br/><br/>Think about a smartphone or touchscreen device, how do you scroll on that? If you want to scroll down you must push the page up - it's inverted. Yet we all just see this as natural, the norm, and get on with it.<br/><br/>Apple decided though that this was going to be <i>the </i>way to scroll and made it the default across their mac product line with 10.7. I say all part of making the Mac more adoptable to new users from iOS.<br/><br/>It&rsquo;s quite an interesting one for me though, which way is really the most intuitive? I think that, while it&rsquo;s not likely to be the same for everyone, I prefer the inverted way and believe that this is the more natural way.<br/><br/>However this does create some problems, switching to a PC and back can sometimes be a little awkward.<br/><br/>Apple has had quite a few feeble feature failures, but in terms of trackpads and input they still win hands down over any other manufacturer.<br/><br/><b>-charlie out-</b></p>
