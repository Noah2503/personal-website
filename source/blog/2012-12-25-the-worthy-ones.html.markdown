I use Mac and Android - I think it’s the perfect combination of things for me. In the same way that an and aspiring author finds interest in books I find interest in programs and serivces. Software can be a work of art, a genuine invention with the power to do good and help us out.I could go on in there and list all the standard ones that are, quite frankly, great, but I’m going to focus on the ‘rarer’ ones.I’ve been back in the Mac Software scene since July, I’ve spent way too long trying and buying interesting apps - these are the favorites:

* [CodeRunner](http://krillapps.com/coderunner/) has already had a mention [here](http://www.charlieegan3.com/2012/12/simple-as-syntax.html) but it deserves a lot more than two mentions. It is a must by for any computer science student and has already saved me a huge amount of time on my course. It’s got a great UI and works perfectly for everything I’ve needed from it so far. I look forward to seeing where this one goes in 2013 - It has the potential to go very far.
* [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/2) (nit just) Another dev tool. This one has also been a big help especially in my recent Rails assignment. It is also very well designed and will be my text editor of choice for the foreseeable future.
* [Espresso](http://macrabbit.com/espresso/), a more recent addition to the list and perhaps even more deserving than the rest. Espresso is helping me move in a new direction with my computing studies and I’m looking forward to where that is going to be. It is just the perfect package for what I wan’t right now. It even inspired me to try coffee again, however that was less successful - I really can’t do coffee.
* [Day One](http://dayoneapp.com/) is not a dev tool - It is a beautifully simple private journal. I’ve been using it since september to record my thought and plans - it’s great, so far I’ve been able to keep up with my goal of one entry per day.
* [Sparrow](http://www.sparrowmailapp.com/) this humble mail client - keeping my mail browser independent since July! Basically is the simplicity of gmail built into OSX. It truly is a great tool and should be your first download on any new mac. It’s been a real help and has been one of the best fivers I’ve ever spent. With Sparrow it’s not about what it does but instead how it does it - perfection.

I’ve had my Android [Note II](http://www.charlieegan3.com/2012/12/phase-of-phablet-review.html) since I realized that my student life requires a smart phone in late October. I’ve not spent nearly as much here but there have still been some good finds.

* [Endomondo](http://www.endomondo.com/login) has been a real help in achieving my 5k goals this year. While I don’t run with it every time it has allowed me to get some interesting 5k routes for me to train on. I’ve tried the competitors out but the features are second to none. It’s after run map and stats are a little addictive but are useful too. A great app all round.
* [Keymonk](http://keymonk.com/) is another [repeat](https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&ved=0CDQQFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.charlieegan3.com%2F2012%2F12%2Fkeymonk-keyboard.html&ei=teLUUO-0I-ao0AWpxYHgBA&usg=AFQjCNGQdx9S0-M-PDOJAHM5bg3gxoQ5JA&sig2=kjzaHP5d-nolbJOWh6HIRA), it’s just too great not to mention again. Take a look at my 'review’ for more details as to why this keyboard deserves a little more recognition.
* [Google Maps](https://maps.google.co.uk/) is has been really useful in perfecting my routes through the freezing city of Aberdeen. It's beautifully implemented on Android and is more than deserving of a mention.

I’ve not included apps that are associated with services or games, they’ll be up tomorrow.

Have a Merry Christmas.
