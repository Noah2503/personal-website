<p><b><br/></b>Most people who code, certainly at my age, are self-taught to a degree. I would certainly say that I am. While school may have got me interested anything interesting I&rsquo;ve ever done has been a product of time spentÂ independently.<br/><br/>There&rsquo;s one problem with this however: It can be quite hard to know the this way is the best way. It&rsquo;s easy to figure out and build solutions of your own but to know that that is in fact the best way to do it is almost impossible.<br/><br/>A recent example. I&rsquo;d been working on a rails app and had been doing a little CSS on the side for fun. I was selecting multiple elements by assigning them all the same id tag. It worked well, very well I thought. However, if you&rsquo;re taught CSS, which I am now, you&rsquo;ll know that you should instead be using .classes where you have more than one element to style. ID&rsquo;d are only for single elements.<br/><br/>It makes sense and I can see how it helps which JavaScript but I don&rsquo;t know how I would have found that out on my own. Once you&rsquo;ve found a way that works you tend to stick with it and move on to new problems. This has become a little worry for me on my current database project - How do I know that this is the best way to work it?<br/><b><br/></b><b>-charlie out-</b></p>
