In 2012, before any of my other social networking endeavors, came an very important stage. [MacRumors forums](http://forums.macrumors.com/member.php?u=669532). Apple has always been an interest of mine and I’ve found, after much comparison since 2005, that MacRumors is the best Apple community out there.

I’d sat as a member for quite a while - lurking in the shadows and it wasn't until last year that it really became a big thing. Over the ‘summer of free time’ I put in excessive amounts of time just helping and commenting on the various discussions that popped up. It was a good place to relax for me, I quite enjoy helping spend wisely and having somewhere to post my own musings. It’s certainly increased my knowledge too, not only of the Apple world but also on the general technology topic - it’s been a good thing.

Recently it’s also come in very handy for my blog. On the forums you're allowed to post links in a 'signature’. These appear at the end of every one of your posts - I have over 2000 posts and it’s become a the primary source of traffic. Quite a nice perk.

It was my contribution here that unlocked the door to my larger online presence. I guess the thinking was, well, you’ve already got all those forum posts out there, why not go the rest of the way?

I’ve enjoyed building up the network of networks - it’s been good, I hope the many hours will pay off somewhere down the line. If they don’t then at least I’ll have had fun along the way.
