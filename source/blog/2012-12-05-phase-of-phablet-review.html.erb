That all changed though. I don’t know what is is about student life but a mobile phone is essential, an absolute must. ‘Paying As You Go’ became very expensive and I needed to change my system.</div><div style="background-color: white; color: #444444; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', HelveticaNeue, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 19px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px; outline: none 0px;">The plan had been to hang around for the iPad mini, I had always liked the idea of tablets - just not in their full size. Now though, with my need to make calls, two and two were put together: Smartphone. I almost instantly decided that this was the best option and, not being a big iOS, fan started looking into the Android market. I’d seen an interesting phone on rumour sites: The Galaxy Note II. After waiting for the release, much reading of reviews and a trip to the local 3 Store a purchase of phone and contract was made.</div><div style="background-color: white; color: #444444; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', HelveticaNeue, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 19px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px; outline: none 0px;">It’s big. But that has yet to be a problem - so far it’s size has only made it better.</div><div style="background-color: white; color: #444444; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', HelveticaNeue, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 19px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px; outline: none 0px;">The best traits of the phone itself would have to be the following:</div><ul style="background-color: white; color: #444444; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', HelveticaNeue, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 19px; margin: 10px 0px; outline: none 0px;"><li style="margin: 0px; outline: none 0px;">The screen size makes it comfortable to use for long periods of time - whether that be twitter, reading the news or doodling on the train it always feels natural.</li><li style="margin: 0px; outline: none 0px;">The S-Pen is quite a nice add on and it really does increase the range of activities possible on the device. Most days I tend not to use it, but in those odd moments with complicated tasks it’s only way to get something done. It’s also quite fun for more detailed sketching.</li><li style="margin: 0px; outline: none 0px;">The phone is exceptionally powerful - It scored really high on<a href="http://browser.primatelabs.com/geekbench2/1295419" style="color: #444444; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px; outline: none 0px;" target="_blank">Geekbench</a> and you basically don’t have to wait a any operation - the way it should be I guess.</li></ul><div style="background-color: white; color: #444444; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', HelveticaNeue, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 19px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px; outline: none 0px;">It’s also made stronger with its Android bond, my favourite software features must be:</div><ul style="background-color: white; color: #444444; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', HelveticaNeue, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 19px; margin: 10px 0px; outline: none 0px;"><li style="margin: 0px; outline: none 0px;">The slide down for notifications and common settings must be the most useful - just works perfectly and saves so much time when you’re constantly switching between WiFi and mobile data, silent and normal…</li><li style="margin: 0px; outline: none 0px;">The way apps and widgets are handled is also great. The seven, totally customizable home screens took some time to get perfected but now they’re setup they’re really useful. I have (from left to right) News; todos; popular contacts; common apps + twitter, SMS, Email, Data usage + more apps.</li><li style="margin: 0px; outline: none 0px;">Finally, tethering is a handy feature to use on the train, and is all handled by: Android OS.</li></ul><div style="background-color: white; color: #444444; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', HelveticaNeue, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 19px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px; outline: none 0px;">Some of the greatest fun though is in the apps, but I’ll save them for another day.</div><div style="background-color: white; color: #444444; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', HelveticaNeue, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 19px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px; outline: none 0px;">It’s become an all round and perfect solution to information and communication on the go. I’m really glad that this problem pushed me into getting it because, having experienced it now I couldn’t have lived with iOS - and my objection to iOS is definitely a story for another day!</div><div style="background-color: white; color: #444444; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', HelveticaNeue, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 19px; margin-bottom: -5px; margin-top: 10px; outline: none 0px;"><strong style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-top: 0px; outline: none 0px;">-charlie out-</strong></div>
