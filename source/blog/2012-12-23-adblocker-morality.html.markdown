In June of next year I will hopefully be able to get [AdSense](http://www.google.co.uk/adsense) on my site. To get access you need 6 months of time adding content. I imagine it will pay out next to nothing - In fact I’m certain of it. There isn’t likely to be enough traffic even by then, still I’m keen to give it a go. Hopefully things will still be happening here in June.

Anyway this topic brings me on to a more interesting one. I currently use [Adblock Plus](http://adblockplus.org/en/) and thanks to that I just don’t see ads. This is great if you’re on a slow connection like I am - it means less waiting time. That said, I think that it is our job as web users to at least look at the adds to keep the free services we use up and running.

Many of these services, like my [favorite forum site](http://www.macrumors.com/), are funded almost completely by AdSense revenue.  If we want to keep using these _free_ services then we are going to have to keep loading the ads.

I’m not really sure how I think ads should be handled on the internet - it’s a difficult one. I think the more intelligent the ads are the better - I’m never going to click on instant fat or wrinkle removal. I think all ads need to be a little more tailored and relevant to the user.

I will pay to remove ads, I’ll get a ‘premium account’ where I feel it's appropriate. Just donating to Adblock doesn’t feel quite right!
