<p>Two weeks ago I started working for a local IT business as a Technician, here&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve learnt.</p>
<p>People are really troubled by their computers, I would go as far to say the older generation are, on average, scared of them. They think that the computer is far more intelligent than it is - they often think it does things autonomously. They believe that it does things that are impossible for it to have done.</p>
<p>The fear is often caused by over estimation of the damage they might. Chances are they couldn&rsquo;t loose their data if they tried. There&rsquo;s a common misconception that computers are built with no safeguards.</p>
<p>People don&rsquo;t understand their needs. For instance, if they think they get &lsquo;a lot of email&rsquo; they assume they need a large hard-disk. In fact, all they really need is a small hard-disk. People still don&rsquo;t understand common space requirements.</p>
<p>So there&rsquo;s the observations. In terms of trends&hellip;</p>
<p>People want tablets but expected to pay a 10th of the price that they paid for their laptop. Or they bring in a 5 year old toshiba and expect a free tablet. Either that or want all their MS Office document in 'all the same places&rsquo;. For those who don&rsquo;t know, this is not possible!</p>
<p>People want new computers but want them to behave exactly like their old ones. There&rsquo;s something good in keeping things similar, but please for the love of god don&rsquo;t let that stop you seeing improvements in interfaces and designs!</p>
<p>People are happy to pay for your time out of their sight but not for your time that is their time also. Totally illogical, but is understandable - andÂ <span>somewhat </span><span>amusing.</span></p>
<p>People seems to think that Mac and iPads are totally different. Macs are a rip off, iPads are the tablet bread and butter. This interested me. iPads are the most expensive tablets money can buy. Do people see them as better value than macs?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been a very educational experience thus far, and not just about customers. There&rsquo;s more to come on the topic of the IT trade.</p>
