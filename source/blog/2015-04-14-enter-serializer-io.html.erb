<p>I&rsquo;ve tried time and time again to make following tech news work for me. It seems to be an inordinately tough problem (for me) to solve (for myself).</p><p>In the early days it was simple, I followed <i>MacRumors</i> and <i>Engadget</i>. I just visited their sites regularly. As I explored a little and discovered some other sites I wanted to follow the need for a basic news reader arose. I also started to read stories on more than one device. After some experimentation I settled on <i>Feedly</i>. I got into this around the time that <i>Google Reader</i> was being phased out and <i>Feedly</i> certainly served me well.</p><p><i>Feedly</i> synced reading progress well but didn&rsquo;t seem all that great at syncing the news! It was often the case that upon reaching the ‘end&rsquo; you&rsquo;d find there were another 20, and then another 20 and so on&hellip; This grew to annoy me quite a bit and I started to look elsewhere.</p><p>At the beginning of 2014 it became clear there wasn&rsquo;t an app or service that offered all the features I saw as essential. Marking as read, reliable story sync being the main two. Polling feeds takes time and I realized that I needed to do this part myself - or get write something so Heroku did it for me.</p><p>I built a Rails app that polled my chosen feeds and grouped stories if they were deemed to be the same. This solved the duplicate story problem that grew out of following a greater number of sources. Each day the application would send me an email of the the top stories, based on degree of reporting overlap. I used this for around 2 months.</p><p>A combination of <i>IFTTT&rsquo;s</i> new twitter search trigger and wanting to follow <i>newsyc20</i> on twitter made me leave <i>&lsquo;Article Engine&rsquo;</i> behind (yep that&rsquo;s what I called it&hellip;). Using the <i>IFTTT</i> trigger I setup daily emails all the matching tweets. Luckily places like <i>Macrumors</i> &amp; <i>Engadget</i> all tweet new articles. This was the longest lasting solution - It took about a few good months to show any signs of cracks and almost a year to be retired. In the end it had to go when it started missing tweets and sometimes emails summaries too.</p><p>In an effort to cut back on news consumption (to focus on some exams) I started <b>only</b> following <i>Hacker News</i>. I think <i>Hacker News</i> is great and earlier this year I created a tool to make it work even better - for me.</p><p>I wanted the content of <i>Hacker News</i> in a <b>feed</b> and I wanted my progress along this feed to sync across devices. Enter <i>serializer</i>!</p><figure data-orig-width="2868" data-orig-height="1602" class="tmblr-full"><img src="https://41.media.tumblr.com/52abaa7a8001ab42c8a4971518aeb083/tumblr_inline_nmtenb8Ifb1rj8eap_540.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="2868" data-orig-height="1602"/></figure><p><i>serializer</i> became a hosted side project of mine with its own domain after reading <a href="http://www.slashie.org/articles/shipping-side-projects/" target="_blank">this post</a> about ‘shipping’ side projects. That inspired to change <i>serializer</i> into something that might be useful to others.</p><p><i>hckrnews.com</i> ticks the linear box but doesn&rsquo;t have any syncing / saving of state.</p><p>So instead I built <i>serializer </i>into a tool with these features:</p><ul><li>   Read-to-here marker<br/></li><li>   Sessions for cross-device syncing without logins<br/></li><li>   Customizable source feeds for users who aren&rsquo;t me (I currently track /all)<br/></li><li>   Reading time estimates (based on 300wpm and a simple page content extractor)<br/></li><li>   Tweet counts for recent items<br/></li><li>   Basic duplicate removal<br/></li></ul><p>My session also has a save to <i>Trello</i> button who kindly host my 'multilevel reading list&rsquo;. I plan on ‘releasing’ this at a later date.</p><p>I have <i>lobste.rs, slashdot, betalist, macrumors, qudos, designer news </i>&amp;<i> arstechnica</i> as well as <i>HN</i>, <i>r/programming </i>&amp; <i>producthunt</i> as selectable sources on /custom.</p><p>serializer feels like it&rsquo;s here to stay as my source of news - perhaps largely due to the amount of work it&rsquo;s been!</p><p>If you&rsquo;re interested <a href="http://www.serializer.io" target="_blank">take a look</a> and let me know what you think.</p>
