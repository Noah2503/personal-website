<p><br/>Another 10.8 Mountain Lion corrective post here. I was reading OSX Daily and came across <a href="http://osxdaily.com/2012/08/27/enable-save-as-os-x-mountain-lion/" target="_blank">this</a>, an article about how to bring back the lost save as feature.<br/><br/>I have only ever found the replacement &lsquo;Duplicate&rsquo; feature to be annoying - never useful. I just can&rsquo;t see the motivation to make this change. I suppose it&rsquo;s like make a copy and open it, rather than make a copy and save it.<br/><br/>Normally I find though that I want to keep working on the current document and save it in it&rsquo;s current state, not to further clutter my workspace with more active documents.<br/><br/>Some of the other refinements are good however, such as the delete option when closing an unsaved file. It makes it very clear - you&rsquo;re going to loose this file. However the 'Duplicate&rsquo;, option to me, was just an odd mistake.<br/><br/><b>-charlie out-</b></p>
