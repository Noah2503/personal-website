I was wary of kickstater for quite some time - It didn’t stock much in the idea. I guess I saw it as being a little risking in the beginning.

As of yesterday however I’ve now backed two projects: [NFC Ring](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/mclear/nfc-ring) and [Pressy](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/556341540/pressy-the-almighty-android-button).

There’s something quite satisfying about the experience. Not only to you get a truly innovative gadget but you feel that you’re helping set someone up for good, helping introduce some new talent and ideas into the industry.

Despite having yet to receive my NFC ring my experience so far has been very positive with the whole affair. I’ll be sure to put up a full review of each when they arrive.
