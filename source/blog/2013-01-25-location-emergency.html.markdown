After a discussion a about a week ago I found myself wondering how much longer it must have taken to call the emergency services in the past. Sprinting to the nearest phone box etc. just doesn’t bear thinking about.

Now of course everyone has a mobile phone, this has completely changed things and has certainly saved many lives along the way. My thought’s strayed to how we could use technology once again improve our ability to help in people in need of help.

Also about a week ago I was ask which street’s I used to get for A to B. I had no clue, none at all. I know less than ten street names in the whole city. What if I was required to describe my location in an emergency?

This task is what I propose we improve next.

Instead of an ‘Emergency Dialer’ we have a single button on the phone’s lock screen. You have to press it and perhaps a combination to ensure that it’s not done in error. Warnings should display (fines for pranks etc.) and it’s important that anyone in a state of shock could use it - avoid being needlessly complex.

Once 'Emergency Mode’ was activated the phone would turn on it’s GPS, get it’s location and send this as a text to the emergency services. On receiving the text they would then call the user.

There are a few other optional features, a method to send the service required as part of the text and an option to just call the services in the traditional way.

I think that this would really help people in a crisis and, while I can see why it’s not here already, I think if there is talk of tweeting emergency services then this should be considered too. Personally I think the [tweet idea](http://blog.whiteoaks.co.uk/2012/12/20/-999-emergency-services-putting-their-trust-in-social-media.aspx) is daft, totally unsure how that helps anyone.
