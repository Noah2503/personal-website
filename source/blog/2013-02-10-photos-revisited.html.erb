<p>I used to take quite a few photos - digital photography and Photoshop were really what got me into computers in the first place. I did have a go at submitting to <a href="http://www.istockphoto.com/" target="_blank">istockphoto</a> with a few of my better ones. They were only ever interested in ‘happy people shots’ and I didn’t like taking pictures of people - so that died off. The next thing was <a href="http://deviantart.com/" target="_blank">deviantart.com</a> a few years later but I got bored of that too and closed my account.</p>
<p>There’s been a serious amount of down time on the photo front and I've decide to change that. With my phone I can use sharing services right from that and geotag photos - add an extra dimension.</p>
<p>I’ve been looking into <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/92984649@N06/" target="_blank">flickr</a> and <a href="http://instagram.com/charlieegan3" target="_blank">Instagram</a></p>
<p> and now have both. Instagram gets a bad rap but quite frankly has the better app. I’ve set up a few IFTTT recipes to sync new photos to flickr and on to Twitter after that to get round the Instagram anti-Twitter policy.</p>
<p>I’m liking it so far and have added one new photo (others taken previously) - thinking about trying to do one each day - however I doubt there are that many nice places to photograph on campus.</p>
<p>I like to keep this blog <em>purely </em>text and will not be posting photos on here - there are also storage space limits which I want to remain shy of.</p>
