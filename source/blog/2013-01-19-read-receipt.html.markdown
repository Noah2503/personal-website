I quite like to know when someone reads a message I send them. I also like the idea that they can see that I’ve read their message and should expect a reply. I used to use read receipts in my email a long time ago but they were wrong so much of the time that I just stopped bothering. Facebook now has this feature, and, while I spend as little time on Facebook as I can, I have to admit that this is a good addition.

It’s also helpful to know when people have seen posts in groups too - it’s nice to get a feel for the amount of interest in a post. This feature allows you to gauge the response purely by taking an estimate at the ratio of views to comments and likes.

While I like it for my messages too I can see why you might not, I think that Facebook should give you the option to disabled it but they don’t, so you can use [this](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fb-unseen/ihcedcpmfdpjijiamkaeaefgfagnnpei/details?hl=en) extension instead. After all it is a bit of an invasion of privacy.
