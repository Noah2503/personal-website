I started listening to podcasts - looking back I ought to have started much sooner. Currently I listen to everything 5by5 RoR, Programming Throwdown and Stack Exchange - I'm also a Changelog Member. They've been a great help with longer runs.

Podcasts coupled with serializer have lead to an ever growing number of cool things to check out. This 'problem' now lives in its own special Trello board.
