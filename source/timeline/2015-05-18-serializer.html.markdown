In an attempt to keep up with the social news sites Hacker News and Product Hunt while the workload piled on I built the [serializer](http://serializer.io) news reader as a procrastination activity.

After using the tool for some time I bought the domain and began doing a little casual promotion - it ended up on Product Hunt - [more here](/blog/2015/05/22/building-and-shipping-my-side-project.html).

I've also accumulated a very long reading list. Recently I've been keeping a list of some highlights of [here](/articles) - of the articles I do get round to reading.
