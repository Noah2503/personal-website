In June 2016 I completed my undergraduate degree with a first in Computer Science at the University of Aberdeen. While I might go back to studying some day; I think I'm going to do something different for a while. Despite initially being more than a little uncertain that university was for me, I got a great deal out of my time in Aberdeen. I particularly enjoyed working on my [final honours project](https://github.com/charlieegan3/standpoint).
