I [registered](https://who.is/whois/charlieegan3.com) charlieegan3.com as a place to live on the Internet. History of the 'stack' has been something like: blogger, tumblr, gh-pages, heroku (rails app), jekyll and now... middleman!

At the same time I started something of a regular blog - I worked at it quite hard posting *everyday* for a few months. I still try and post _about_ once a month!
