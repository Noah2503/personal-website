I teamed with a fellow student to build a running race time estimator. The idea was too use data from [powerof10](http://www.thepowerof10.info/) to build a basic model for race times. Then given some times by the user we'd be able to find similar runners and make an estimate based on that.

We got *most* of that in - just not all of it. We didn't stand a chance against some of the others, Refactor Cop for example! I'm signed up again for this year.
