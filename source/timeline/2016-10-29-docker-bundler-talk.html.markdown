I prepared a talk about the pain of bundler in Docker and neat solution we came
up with for the problem. I first presented the talk at the October meeting of
the London Ruby User Group and then later at the Northern Lights Conference
in Aberdeen. The slides are online [here](https://cdn.rawgit.com/charlieegan3/4ccc5dc72fede1b92325ea78146b1760/raw/ae69072e1d39e28d916fa3e1abe07e36a8770330/slides.html)
, the example repo with our solution is [here](https://github.com/charlieegan3/bundlecache).
