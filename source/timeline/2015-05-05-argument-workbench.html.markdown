I worked with a fellow student on an semantic search extension to an annotation tool. We built an [indexer and Django web app](https://github.com/IllegalCactus/argument-workbench) to enable the annotated text to be queried for argumentation features.

I got the chance to write a threaded indexer in Rust and explore the Django framework as well as learn more about Natural Language Processing as a research area.
