I worked on [Travel Turbine](http://github.com/charlieegan3/travel-turbine) with a [fellow student](https://github.com/IllegalCactus). The application compared various modes of transport within the U.K. and made use of web scraping for data collection. We've kept the project on online and I see it as my first 'useful' app.

An [NSA tool](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2014/03/12/snowden_docs_show_nsas_malware_turbine_can_pump_out_millions_of_malware_attacks) for mass data collection also called *Turbine* was leaked less than a week after we finished working on the project!
