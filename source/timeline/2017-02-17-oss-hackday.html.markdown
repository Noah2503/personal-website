I spent a day working on some failing tests for [jbuilder](https://github.com/rails/jbuilder) with [Elena](https://twitter.com/elenatanasoiu). A long and frustrating day - but we learnt a lot. Eventually; with more than a little prompting, [a commit made it into jbuilder](https://twitter.com/charlieegan3/status/834177190853947392)!
