I had a fantastic summer with the folks at Unboxed, a London-based Rails consultancy. Highlights include having a core team member as a mentor, finally understanding CSS specificity and working on a client project. I wrote a more detailed post [here](/blog/2014/09/29/unboxed.html), I also featured on the [company blog](https://www.unboxedconsulting.com/blog/summer-unboxin-had-me-a-blast).
