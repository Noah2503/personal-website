I attended the Google Cloud platform conference and learnt about all the cool
Google things. While the event had very clear agenda - upselling GCP - it was a
great day with some really good sessions. I contributed to a write-up of the
event [here on the unboxed blog](https://unboxed.co/blog/next-london-2016-google-cloud-platform-s-user-conference/).
