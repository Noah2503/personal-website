As a follow on from my honors project; I worked with my supervisors to publish the work as a conference paper for the [2016 Argument Mining Workshop](http://argmining2016.arg.tech). You can find the paper [here on Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=pqb-ZNAAAAAJ&citation_for_view=pqb-ZNAAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C).
