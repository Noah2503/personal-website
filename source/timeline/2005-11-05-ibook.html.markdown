I got my first computer, an Apple iBook G4. I used it for Photoshop (I tried and failed to get past iStock selection - those guys are strict).

I also played Nanosaur 2 and some of the other included games. We didn't get ADSL until some time after 'everyone else' - I got new software by subscribing to Macworld!
