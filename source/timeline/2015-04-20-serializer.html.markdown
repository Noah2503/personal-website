In an attempt to keep up with the social news sites Hacker News and Product Hunt while the workload piled on I built [serializer](http://serializer.io) as a procrastination activity.

The app collects stories from a number of sources and 'serializes' them in a single sequential stream. It has read-to marker and loginless cross-device syncing.

After using the tool for some time I bought the domain and began doing a little casual promotion - it ended up on Product Hunt - so that was fun. I wrote about the experience [here](/blog/2015/05/22/building-and-shipping-my-side-project.html).

I've also accumulated a very long reading list. Recently I've been keeping a list of some highlights of [here](/articles) - of the articles I do get round to reading.
