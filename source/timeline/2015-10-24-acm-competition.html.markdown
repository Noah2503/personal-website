In an attempt to better our score 2014 score team woolloomooloo returned, as a duo - 1 man down. We were able to submit solutions for three problems, sadly none were correct.

I'd been using [Kattis](https://open.kattis.com/) as practice but it wasn't enough. The questions were quite a bit harder than last year, based on the performance of the top teams as well as our own.
