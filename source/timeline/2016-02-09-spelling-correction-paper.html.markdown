At the end of 2015 I wrote a [paper](/blog/2016/02/09/query-corruption-paper/query_corruption_egan.pdf) titled *The effect of query length and search engine identity on computerised spelling correction of corrupted queries*. I was interested to test the correction performance of a number of search engines - the third last and final graph are likely the most interesting plots.
