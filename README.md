# charlieegan3.com

This is the repo for my personal site, [charlieegan3.com](charlieegan3.com).
The site has gone through a number of revisions, take a look at the [way back
machine](https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://charlieegan3.com).

The purpose of the site is to act as an online introduction that I have complete
control over (unlike social networks). I also sometime use it to play with new
things, Middleman for example.

This is a 'static site'. However, it does make a request to a 
[JSON file](https://s3.amazonaws.com/charlieegan3/status.json) that represents
my 'current state'. This is updated by a 
[separate project](https://github.com/charlieegan3/json-charlieegan3).

My username, charlieegan3, comes from my selection of a Gmail address in 2005.
Three is my primary school 'Lucky Number'; and Charlie Egan is my name!
