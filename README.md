# Personal Website

This is the repo for my personal website. Take a look at [charlieegan3.com](https://charlieegan3.com). The site is a 
semi-professional online space which I enjoy having complete control over.

Currently, the site consists of a custom [Go](https://go.dev) CMS and is hosted on [Northflank](https://northflank.com)
as part of a [toolbelt](https://github.com/charlieegan3/toolbelt) deployment.

My username, `charlieegan3`, comes from my selection of a Gmail address in
2005. _3_ was (is?) my lucky number.
