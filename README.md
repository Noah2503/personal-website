# Personal Website

This repo contains the source code used to run my personal website at 
[charlieegan3.com](https://charlieegan3.com).

My website is a personal online space which I enjoy having creative control over.

Currently, the site consists of a custom-built [Go](https://go.dev) CMS and is hosted on
[Northflank](https://northflank.com) as part of a
[toolbelt](https://github.com/charlieegan3/toolbelt) deployment. This repo also contains
the historic implementations of all the previous versions of the site.

My username, `charlieegan3`, comes from my selection of a Gmail address in
2005. _3_ was (is?) my lucky number.
