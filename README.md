# Personal Website

This is the repo for my personal website,
[charlieegan3.com](https://charlieegan3.com).

The site is a semi-professional online space that I have control over. I also
sometimes use it to try out new things like Middleman, GAE, Netlify, tachyons
CSS, Terraform, Cloudfront, Codebuild, Hugo etc.

My username, `charlieegan3`, comes from my selection of a Gmail address in
2005. _3_ was my primary school lucky number.
